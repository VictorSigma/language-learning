I love mystery novels, especially the trashy ones. This synopsis’ll get you up to speed on all that evil grave robbing vocabulary you missed in class.
There are three names in this text that are Chinese transliterations of English names, so I’ve given it my best guess. The first, 弗里德曼, I didn’t even try to translate, so I stuck with Fulideman (Fleiderman?). For the second, 利普霍恩, I went with Philip Horn. And the third, 吉姆•契, I went with Jim Qi. If anyone’s got a more standard translation for these names, please leave a comment!

A historically important American Indian tomb has attracted a large number of expert archaeologists, but has also attracted a viscious and merciless grave robber known as “The Theif of Time”.

　　

Young archaeologist Dr. Fulideman has gone missing; two incidents of theft have happened near the police station; a mysterious missionary appears and vanishes; a grave robber dies tragically near the tomb… what is the connection between these events? How will widower Phillip Horn and down-on-his-luck Jim Qi untangle the riddle?  
Those who rob graves and disturb the souls of the dead inevitably will suffer retribution.
