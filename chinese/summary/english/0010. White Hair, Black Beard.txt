A slightly silly joke courtesy of the March 2006 print issue of Youth Digest.
I’m not actually 100% sure about 威廉期 meaning “Williams”. This is most certainly a name, 威廉 is most certainly “William”, and 期 is most certainly the character “Qi”, however, these characters put together might be some kind of transliteration for a slightly different English surname, like Williamson or something. As usual, grappling with English / Chinese name transliteration is a pain.

Mr. Williams was traveling in Mexico. One day, he saw a very strange man on the street. This person’s hair was snow white, however his beard was black. He curiously went up and asked, “Why is your hair white, but your beard is black?”
The man answered, “What’s weird about that? My hair is 20 years older than my beard, how could they be the same?”
