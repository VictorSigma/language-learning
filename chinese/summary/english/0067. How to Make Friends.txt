Just in case you were wondering, below is a short intermediate essay on How to Make Friends.
This article was both written and translated into English by a Chinese student on her own blog. I wish I could remember where I found it now, as I’d like to give the credit where credit is due, but it’s been sitting in my “drafts” folder forever. The Chinese title is 如何交朋友.

Everyone needs friends. A friend can give us help and share our difficulties and happiness. But how can we make friends? 
First, to make friends, you must be friendly to others. Smile at others and you are sure to get a smile in return. You should try to make a stranger feel at home wherever he happens to be. Think more of others than of yourself and never judge a person by their appearance and clothes. 
Second, friends should negotiate instead of quarrel. When you don’t agree with someone, discuss the issue with them. 
Finally, never trust in those who leave you when you are in trouble. And never leave your friends when they are in trouble. Remember, a friend in need is a friend indeed. [Literally: During difficult situations, you will see the truth]
Friends should be faithful to each other. So long as you can put your friend’s interests in front of yours, you will have a lot of good friends.
