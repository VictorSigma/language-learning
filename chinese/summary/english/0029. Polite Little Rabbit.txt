A children’s story meant to show kids an example of the right way to be polite to their elders.
The Chinese title of this story is 懂礼貌的小兔.


 ----------- 


The blisteringly hot days of summer had come, and all of the birds in the trees were crying, “It’s hot, it’s hot!” 
A beautiful little white rabbit wearing a pretty floral skirt and humming a song, bounced vivaciously onto a bridge. It wanted to cross to the other side [of the bridge] to gather mushrooms. 
Just at that moment, it saw that Uncle Goat was standing on the other side of the bridge preparing to cross. The bridge was very narrow, and only one creature could cross at a time.
The little white rabbit saw this, and stopped walking, saying loudly, “Uncle Goat, you go across the bridge first!” Saying this, it retreated from the bridge. 
Uncle Goat put on his glasses, leaned on his walking stick, and began to slowly cross the bridge. Uncle Goat wasn’t careful for a moment and he fell over. Frightened, Little White Rabbit loudly yelled: “Uncle Goat, be careful as you cross the bridge!” 
Uncle Goat crossed the bridge and patted the little rabbit on the head in praise, saying: “You’re very well-behaved!”
