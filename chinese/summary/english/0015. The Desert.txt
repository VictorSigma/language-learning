This is a very short beginner children’s joke.
The Chinese title of this joke is “沙漠”, desert. Read the original on Tom61

Teacher: “A desert is a long, wide place, its surface is very bright, and not a single thing grows there.”

Primary School Student: “Teacher, I understand. My father’s bald head is a strip of desert.”
