Gotta love dream dictionaries – this online Chinese dream interpretation site categorizes dream meanings based on symbolism. This page addresses what it means when someone dreams about a temple (寺庙 – sì miào).
Though some of the language is undoutedly advanced, the sentence structure is super short and repetitive, so I’m classifying this as intermediate an intermediate read.
