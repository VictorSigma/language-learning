This short bullet-pointed list was snagged from a health blog. Chinese title: 起床后的第一杯水的重要性
Very heavy on the medical language, this quick post outlines five health benefits to have a glass of water upon waking up. I’m not 100% sure on the definition of 血溶量 – this translates to “level of blood solubility”, or literally “blood dissolve level” – no dictionary or translator has been able to help me out with this one, so if you’ve got a good answer, please post a comment!

1. Replenishes water levels: Replenishes water lost by the body

2. Prevents constipation: Stimulates intestinal movement, moistens the intestines, promotes evacuation of the bowels, prevents and cures constipation

3. Cleanses the digestive system: Rinses the digestive system clean, dilutes gastric acid, alleviates stomach irritation, maintains optimal digestive health [lit: maintains optimal stomach and intestinal situation]

4. Clear-headedness: Increases blood solubility, dilutes the blood, reduces blood thickness, promotes circulation

5. Beauty: Purges toxins
