I’ve been idly looking at moving to a new apartment lately (looks like I won’t be moving after all – a good thing, too, because I like my current place), and I typically use the Chinese property search sites instead of the foreign ones. The prices are about 4 times as high on the English sites made for foreigners, and the properties they offer there are often aimed at high-rolling executives. It helps quite a bit to be able to browse the Chinese listings, so I’m doing a few here. This is solidly advanced stuff. Local place names abound, so you have to be able to at least guess when something is or isn’t a proper noun, and because we’re working with real estate classifieds, a few words are shortened to save space or the formal version is used to sound professional.
One thing to bear in mind if you’re actually looking for an apartment in China is that quite a few of the pictures are fake, are from other houses in the same compound, or if you’re dealing with an agency, you should know that most places online have been rented already, but the agencies have left the ads up in hopes you’ll call them anyway and they can show you something else.
You really do have to go hunt around in person in China, but online apartment hunting can give you a few valuable pieces of info: what types of apartments are available in which areas (only old buildings? skyrises? hutong-houses?), which complexes are newer and have nicer amenities, and what apartments in a particular area usually go for.
Here are three of the best and most popular Beijing real estate websites, if you want to practice on your own:
bj.58.com/zufang/
beijing.anjuke.com
zu.soufun.com/
I’m going to list and translate a few different Beijing listings here, but I won’t link to the original listings as I imagine they’ll come down fairly fast, so I’ll just show a couple of photos. You can visit the links above for similar stuff. I’m taking some examples from a little spectrum: one crappy (and very very typical) older apartment near Beijing, a cheaper and nicer apartment in the distant suburbs of Beijing, a high-rolling super luxury apartment city-center, and a traditional-style siheyuan home.
You’ll see a lot of similarities between real estate and property listings in Beijing or anywhere, but a couple of major points of local flavor:
押一付三　- This indicates how rent is paid. In Beijing, rent is not paid monthly. It can either be paid every three months, every six months, or you can pay the whole year in advance. This indicates rent is to be paid every 3 months (付三), which is by far the most common way to pay, and that a one-month deposit will be required (押一).
朝向南北 – Man, the Chinese sure do care which way their apartment faces. People here will flat-out turn down an east/west facing place if they can afford to. The best apartments, apparently, face south / north, so you get sun all day, but it’s not blasting in your windows. Less ideal is when a place faces east / west – and people here care SO MUCH about this, that you can get a cheaper place if you don’t care that it faces east/west (though for haggling purposes, you’re better off pretending you do care). This is why the direction is front and center.
