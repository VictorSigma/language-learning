Sweet! I found a bunch of Chinese riddles. Read the Chinese and try to guess the word! This is VERY short, lower-intermediate reading.
Some of the riddles I found are impossible, because not only is the riddle hard, the answer is a kind of fruit or plant or thing I’ve never heard of, so I’m skipping past all those and over the next few days I’ll post a few riddles that are answerable for those of us who didn’t grow up in the southern Yao jungles or whatever.
I think the most interesting word in this text is 青. I see this word everywhere, and I’ve never been able to come up with an English equivalent. It’s not green, and it’s not blue… well, it’s not actually a color. It means “the color that nature is”. It can be used to describe a clear green pond. It can be used to talk about trees or grass. So it’s not actually a specific hue, but the word is used as if it is. Someone feel free to dive in if you can think of a good translation for this.
This particular riddle kinda rhymes in Chinese, so when you’ve sorted out the words, read it out loud.

Translation: Green branches green leaves but it’s not a vegetable, some roast it and some dry it, soaring on clouds and sailing the mist it’s consumed, it’s not sold boiled in a pot.
Answer: 烟叶 (Tobacco)
