This is the second in a series of short reads where I take short posts from Sina Weibo (the Chinese Twitter) and translate them here.
This thoughtful, heady little blurb talks vaguely about the roll that patience plays in seeing us through adversity.


 ----------- 


The bigger your goal, the bigger your difficulties. Patience is the key that will open the door of wealth, it’s a light as you pass through darkness; patience can make your difficulties become easy, can turn your willpower into strength. Patience doesn’t mean that you should simply grin and bear your troubles, or that you should resign yourself to surrender. Life’s great changes will bury your secret suffering in an abyss, but patience will inevitably make the heart’s secret suffering disappear, and the sky after the tempest will be that much more beautiful.
