A very simple story about three friendly butterflies who stick up for each other.


 ----------- 


In the garden there were three butterflies, one red one, one yellow one, and one white one. Every day the three good friends played together, it was great. One day just as they were playing, it suddenly began to rain. The three butterflies’ wings were drenched by the rain, their whole bodies were trembling with cold. 
The three butterflies few together to a red flower, and said to it: “Big Sister Red Flower, let us hide from the rain under your leaves.” 
The red flower said: “The red butterfly can come in, but the others must leave.”
The three good friends shook their heads together: “We’re good friends, we came together, and we’ll leave together.”
They flew off to a yellow flower, and to the yellow flower said, “Big Sister Yellow Flower, let us hide from the rain under your leaves.” The yellow flower said: “The yellow butterfly can come in, but the others must leave.”
The three good friends shook their heads and said: “We’re good friends, we came together, and we’ll leave together.”
Then, they flew away to the white flower, and to the white flower said: “Big Sister White Flower, let us hide from the rain under your leaves!”  
But the white flower said to them: “The white butterfly can come in, but the rest must leave.” 
The three good friends still shook their heads together and said: “We’re good friends, we came together and we’ll leave together.”
At this time, Old Man Sun saw what was happening, and he hurriedly chased the black clouds away and made the rain stop.     
The sky was finally clear, and the three friends again went again to play and dance among the flowers.
