This paragraph introduces “Punk Times Magazine”, and talks a little about its importance in influencing Chinese alternative youth culture.
“Punk Times” is 朋克时代 péng kè shí dài. Though this is definitely a magazine, it looks like it also came with a CD, as there’s a track listing that goes with it. It’s my understanding that along with two other Chinese music magazines 《盛事摇滚》 shèng shì yáo gǔn and 《自由音乐》zì yóu yīn yuè, 朋克时代 is among the cannon of alternative music publications in China (or as one netizen put it, “这三本小册子已成经典” – “these three booklets have already become classics”).

If you feel like doing your own research and you’re interested in Chinese rock, here are the titles of other Chinese music magazines I dug up over the course of this post:
《极端音乐》
《R&非音乐》
《重型音乐》

1998 was absolutely the year in Chinese rock history to be engraved in your mind, as this is the year that music culture magazine “Punk Times” was first published, [a magazine] whose like hadn’t been seen before, and it has never since been surpassed. It set off a civilian firestorm which had a subversive impact on China’s art world towards the end of the last century, as it was the first time a music magazine’s content introduced the spirit of rebellion into the sphere of popular consciousness. At that time, the magazine brought untold numbers of youths into the world of real rock, and [untold numbers] picked up the guitar without looking back, using music to ignite the young.
