Chinese Title: 我们家的跳绳比赛
A single-paragraph essay about the results of a family jump rope competition.
Haven’t had a ton of extra time in the last few weeks – just went on a trip to Dalian, and still catching up from that.


 ----------- 


This morning father and I competed in jump rope, father went first, mother kept time and count, father jumped 128 times in a minute, and when I entered the playing field, father counted and mother took notes. In this round [literally: 'this time', but sounds weird in English because there are no previous times] I made no mistakes, and in one minute I jumped 145 times, my heart pounded in my chest, as if it would bounce right out. Mother abstained from participating, so I became Number 1 in our family, I was very happy.
