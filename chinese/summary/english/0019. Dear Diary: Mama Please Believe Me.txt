And now a break from all the intermediate and advanced exercises I’ve been posting lately. This one is a straightforward beginner Chinese diary-style essay about a student whose mother is displeased with his (or her, it’s never clarified) homework.
There’s only one thing that particularly stands out to me as confusing here, which is when the mother says: 可能是有了小妹妹，我这段时间对你关心少了。 Literally, this translates as “Maybe it’s have small sister, I during this time towards you care little.” The last clause we can translate into less literal and more readable English as “I haven’t looked after you much during this time,” but the first bit, “have small sister” (有了), is confusing. Why “have” 有了?
In this case, that could be translated as, “Maybe it’s because we have your little sister,” or “It’s because I had your little sister [to look after]“, though “because” is never actually used in the sentence, it becomes that much harder to read.

September 24, Saturday
Today, after my parent-teacher conference, mama looked moody, and I carefully asked her, “Mama, what’s wrong?” Looking at me, mother sighed and said: “Your summer vacation homework is not close to being done, and your writing is poor. I think, because [I've been spending so much time with] your little sister, I haven’t been paying as much attention to you during this time.” As I listened, I hung my head in embarrassment. 
When I saw the self-blame on mama’s face, I was very sad, and I said to mama: “Mama, don’t blame yourself, is isn’t your fault at all, it’s that I haven’t worked hard enough, so please don’t be angry, starting now, I’ll earnestly finish all the homework teacher gave me, and I’ll fight to get good grades. Please believe me!” Mama stared into my eyes, grasped my hand and said, “Good child, mother believes you, let us work hard together.”
