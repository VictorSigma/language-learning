Ah, bless romance novels – they’re the same in every language. This short synopses introduces 致命的温柔, “The Gentleness of Self-Sacrifice”, a book by Chinese author 艾米.
The very first clause here, 一次偶然的接机, presents a little conundrum, particularly the term 接机, which generally translates into “picking someone up”, and “airplane”.

After an accidental airport meeting, Carol and Jason fell in love at first sight, loving each other like two months to a flame, hurting each other in their infatuation, and yet feeling increasing tenderness for each other in their pain. Strong and determined Carol doesn’t dare believe in true love due to having been abandoned by her father; gentle and considerate Jason, because a woman previously killed herself over him, suffers from a “serious inability to love”. The two of them are mutually attracted, yet avoid each other, each knowing that they can’t reciprocate the love, but also both unable to convince themselves to walk away from it. When Carol finally becomes determined to face her love, tragedy descends upon Jason…
