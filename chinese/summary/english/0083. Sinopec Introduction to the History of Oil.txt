Sinopec, one of China’s leading oil conglomerates, is currently running an ad targeted at a younger Chinese market on the China Youth Daily home page. The ad encourages young adults to check out Sinopec’s Flash-animated history of oil, completed with the requisite cartoon oil-drop mascot named “You Di” (a homophone for “oil drop”). Using typically expansive language, the lead-in introduces the mascot and the theme of the presentation.

Everyone might think that a single drop of oil is insignificant. A drop on the ground is just a tiny oily smear, and if you put it in a car, the car couldn’t even go a few meters. But we shouldn’t underestimate this little drop of oil. It’s very old, and it’s experienced hundreds of millions of years of evolution, having passed through many thousands of various processes before finally, from the very first animals, becoming the substance we use today in cars, and the petrol and deisel we use in various machines. After this, we’ll take a look at the story of this drop of oil, and we’ll give him a name – how about we call him “You Di”. Because oil truly is the most precious treasure the earth has given us. Our industrial society was built on the foundation of the oil industry. If we didn’t have oil, our machines wouldn’t work, our cars wouldn’t start, and we’d have no way to produce many everyday necessities, even basic things like soap and washing clothes, all these are products of the oil industry.
