A short, sweet children’s essay about how umbrellas look on a rainy day. The Chinese title is 小伞花.
Most of this is beginner reading, but there is one part of a sentence towards the end of the text which is intermediate reading, so I’ve outlined the more difficult words there in the “click to listen” area.
You’ll also notice another onomatopoeia (I’ve been running into those a lot lately), 滴滴答答. We’re rather lucky when we describe sounds in English, we can mash a bunch of letters together until they sound similar to the sound we heard – we have a little more flexibility. I could write: pfffsssshhhh, and you could make that sound, or imagine that sound. The Chinese have no alphabet to work with, so they do this by taking existing characters that sound similar and arranging them together. In this case 滴滴答答 (di1 di1 da1 da1) represents the pattering of raindrops, as you might hear rain fall against a window or roof.

Today, when I had returned to my house and I was doing my homework, I heard the sound of droplets coming from outside, and I thought it surely must be raining. I hurriedly ran to the window, and looked down, on the street the pedestrians were all carrying umbrellas, and it was indeed raining. 
There were yellow umbrellas, and there were white ones, and red ones, and purple ones, and also silver ones… so beautiful!
I thought about how great umbrellas are, they unfurl a sunny and cloudless sky for us, they’re really our good friends. I wish it could rain every day, so that my beautiful little umbrella could accompany me.
