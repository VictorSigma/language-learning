A young child’s thoughts and description of watermelon, their favorite fruit. The Chinese title of this article is 西瓜.



 ----------- 


I eat a lot of fruit, but my favorite is watermelon.
Watermelon is round, and has a striped green design [on it], like a leather ball. 
When you break open a watermelon, it’s surrounded by white skin, in the middle is bright red pulp. Take a bite, it’s so sweet, it’s delicious. I’d love to eat it all up in one mouthful, but mama says you can’t each too much watermelon, if you eat too much you’ll have diarrhea. 
When you finish eating the watermelon, you have to drop the skin in the trash can, you can’t just carelessly litter, because if a person steps on it they can slip and fall.
