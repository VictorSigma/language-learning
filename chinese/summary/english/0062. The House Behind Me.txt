Unlike most Chinese poetry, which requires about 7 billion years of specialized study to understand (and which I won’t even attempt without a translation handy), this poem, originally found in the online version of Youth Digest magazine, is fairly short, only mildly abstract, and extremely melancholy.

I don’t know when it started    I like to walk against the wind    feel the petals blowing against my face

They’re like white, yellow and pink butterflies skipping in the air

I don’t know when it started   I like to run against the wind   gazing at the kites getting farther away as they go higher

They’re like my own dreams flying in the air
When I was small   I sat on the handles of my father’s tall bicycle    and felt his embrace

Later, I sat behind him   and chattered on about the things that had happened that day

Now, I sit on the slope behind him   quietly watching him go about his day

Farther and farther away   truly   farther and farther away.
