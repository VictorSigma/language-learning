If you like spicy food and you like potatoes, and you’ve never had 香辣土豆丝 , you’re missing out. Now when I say “spicy” here, I don’t mean American spicy – this dish comes out of the pan crazy hot depending on the type of peppers you use, so it’s not for the faint of heart. You can, of course, tone down the heat by using less chili oil, and I’ve had it made quite bland before, but if you really want to go authentic, get your spice on.
Done correctly, the potatoes in this dish are of a texture you may not be used to – they’re just barely barely cooked all the way through, and still retain a slight bit of stiffness – not quite a crunch, but almost.
This is one of my favs, but it took a little getting used to.
If you ever needed proof that most Chinese cooking is done by eye, without much measuring, this recipe proves it – “almost”, “add to taste”, “approximately” – these words crop up frequently.
