This very short blurb from Sina.com features an announcement by Twitter chairman Jack Dorsey that Twitter has now exceeded 200 Million users.
I find that when wading through Chinese newsspeak, knowing the word 称 chēng makes all the difference. This is the formal / newspaper version of the word 说　shuō, both words meaning “to say”.
It’s also interesting to note that the phrase “脱口秀” – Talk show – is actually transliterated into Chinese from English. In other words, instead of translating its meaning into something like, “Talking Presenter Program” or similar, they used Chinese characters that sound similar to the English phrase “talk show” – tuō kōu xiù. This literally translates into “Blurt it out performance”, which I’d like to think is a way more accurate description of what usually happens on talk shows. Transliteration FTW.

BEIJING TIME – JANUARY 12 – AFTERNOON NEWS: On Tuesday, Twitter’s Chairman of the Board Jack Dorsey announced that Twitter’s global user base now exceeds 200,000,000, and is projected to exceed Facebook in the future.
Tuesday, during an interview with American talk show host Charlie Rose, Dorsey said that right now 200,000,000 people use Twitter, and although there’s a big gap between that number and Facebook’s 500,000,000 users, he believes Twitter’s user base will eventually exceed that of Facebook.
Dorsey also stated that Twitter’s revenue is currently stable.
