“Thunder God Thor” gives an account of the god from Northern European mythology who controls storms and lightning, who ignited the flames of an ancient war, and [because of this] was banished to live on Earth. But when Earth suffers as evil forces invade the kingdom of Asgard, Thor shoulders the heavy responsibility of protecting Earth, and in doing so learns how to be a real hero.
