As vaguely sordid fables go, this one’s fairly tame, resulting only in some humiliatory retribution and a lost tail or two.

Long  ago, there was a wolf who was always bullying others. One day,  the small animals gathered together to discuss a way to solve the problem. The smart fox thought of a solution.
One day Wolf went out to forage for food, when suddenly  he smelled the scent of roasting fish. When Little Wolf ran into a  mountain cave and looked, he saw that it was Little Fox that was cooking the fish. Fox saw that Wolf had come, and in his heart he was secretly happy.
Wolf asked “Where did these fish come from?”
Fox said, “There is a place where you can catch many fish, I can take you there.”
So Wolf followed Fox as he walked and walked, until they came to a riverbank. There turned out to be a layer of ice over the water.
Fox said, “All you have to do is bore a hole in the ice, stick your tail into the river, wait until the fish bite your tail, then pull your tail out. This way, you’ll catch many, many fish.
Wolf, thinking of how the fish would be more than a full meal, waited quite a while, but no fish bit his tail. Wolf was finally too cold to continue and tried to pull up his tail, but when he turned his head to look, he saw that his tail was stuck in the ice. He gave a  great pull, and what do you know but his tail came off with a “pa”  sound. Wolf fled.
When the other little animals saw wolf’s miserable face, they all laughed.
