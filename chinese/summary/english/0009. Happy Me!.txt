A short, easy (very) beginner read about a child going ice-skating. The word “ice skating” appears about a bazillion times in the space of these few sentences, so, after reading this, you may expect to recognize the word for the rest of your natural life.
A note: The characters 周井寒 which appear in this essay are a person’s name. The person is referred to twice, first by their given name, 井寒, then by their full name, 周井寒. The person’s relationship to the author isn’t really specified. This clearly isn’t the name of the child’s mother, as 周井寒 is referred to as a “he”.
The Chinese title of this essay is 快乐的我.
And here’s the original source


 ----------- 


In the morning, I finished my homework, and [when] mother got up, I said to her: “Mama, I finished all my homework.” After we ate breakfast, mama took me ice skating. When we got to the ice rink, I put on my ice skates and began ice skating. When I was ice skating, I wasn’t being careful and fell down, and Jing Han helped me back up, I repeatedly said: “Thank you, Zhou Jing Han.” Zhou Jing Han fell down, and I also helped him up.  
Today, you help me, I help you, we help each other, we’re so happy!
