If you’re in need of a fable that demonstrates the dangers of kissing ass, you’re in luck.
The Turkey and the Bull makes it pretty clear that (and here I quote) “butt licking” is not the path to success. I started off thinking this was entirely unsuitable for the children’s reading site I found it on, but then again, some of our most beloved fables are all about evil women baking little children in ovens, so… yeah.

A turkey said to a bull: “I really want to fly to the top of that tree, it’s a pity I don’t have any strength.” The bull proposed an idea: “Why don’t you eat a little of my feces, it’s rich in nutrients, hehe.” The turkey thought that this made sense, so he ate [lit: pecked at] a little, and immediately felt strong,  and trying as hard as he could, he flew onto a tree branch. The second day, the turkey ate several mouthfuls of feces, got strength, and flew to an even higher tree branch. After two weeks, when the turkey had eaten enough bull feces, he finally flew to the top of the tree. He gazed into the distance, and just when he was feeling very pleased with himself, a farmer saw him, and quickly opened fire and shot him down. 
The moral of this fable is: licking other people’s butts is a shortcut, and it can get you to a pretty high position very quickly, however it doesn’t last long.
