To commemorate passing my 50th post, I’ll be starting a new series on this blog called “Interesting Headlines”, which will just include several one-line news headlines from major Chinese newspapers, and will hopefully help with newspaper reading skills.
I tend to find that if I can read a headline and get the gist of a story, then I can read the story. But if I can’t grasp the overall concept, it’s difficult to pinpoint what’s being discussed – so I’ll be tackling headlines directly, and linking to the news story. You’re welcome to tackle it if it sounds interesting.
Almost all news headlines, with a few exceptions, are advanced reading material. I know most of my readers are beginner-level, so I apologize for the emphasis on advanced stuff. But the upshot is that news headlines are very short, which may give lower-level readers a shot at tackling something a bit more difficult.
