Apparently, every person in the universe identifies with My So-Called Life. This quick and partial introduction to the mid-90s TV series starring Clare Danes, and is packed full of all kind of great teenage angsty vocabulary you might need if you’re desperate to describe your high school years but don’t know the word for, say, “social idiot”.
This piece was probably extracted from somewhere else, because it doesn’t really start or end, it just kind of… is. It seems like the middle of an essay or review about My So-Called Life, so if you’ve never seen the show you might have a harder time with this than if you haven’t.
Grammatically speaking, this is noteworthy in the sense that even though every sentence starts with a question phrase, no questions are really being asked (and no question marks are used). These sentences should be read in a rhetorical way, similar to the way we’d say, “Isn’t it just the best day?”
The Chinese title of “My So-Called Life” is 《生活没有》 (I have no life).

During your high school years, wasn’t there a central figure like Sharon who was a “perfect” girl, and wasn’t there a callous hot guy like Jordan; and wasn’t there a bookworm like Brian, whose schoolwork was outstanding but who was a complete social idiot? And wasn’t there a best friend like Riche whose own life was a complete mess, but who still helped you get out of predicaments? And a close mother and father who were beginning to find it difficult to understand the changes you were going through? And you, couldn’t you see yourself at 15 years old through Angela’s monologue? From 1994 to 1995 only 19 episodes of My So-Called Life have been broadcast, but its honest style has moved the hearts of many an audience.
