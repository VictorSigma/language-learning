Considering I spend a good deal of time on WeiBo, China’s answer to Twitter, I’m starting a new series of posts called “Micro Blog Posts from WeiBo”.
I’ll take a good “tweet” and translate it here, with a link to the user that posted it. If you’re looking for new and innovative ways to learn Chinese, may I suggest signing up for a WeiBo account of your own? It’s free, it’s not too difficult to sign up (just keep pushing the big green buttons), it’s a great way to get a steady stream of blurbs for practice.
