But not long after this glorious new age began, Kevin mysteriously disappeared. After that, Kevin’s young son Sam (played by Garret Hedlund) inherited his father’s position, but actually the company is run by other employees. Sam is talented, smart and full of adventurous spirit, often causing trouble for the higher-ups at ENCOM. One day, he hears of an abandoned work room via a message which was surprisingly sent from his father. Sam goes to nose around, and is transported into a digital virtual reality world.
