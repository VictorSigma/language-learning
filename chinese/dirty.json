    "englishText": "\nThe history of the pencil is very long, dating back 2000 years to ancient Roman times. The pencils of that time were very crude, being nothing more than a gold cover cripping a lead stick, or even a lead block, and it really was a “lead” pen (not just in name only). Whereas the pencils we use toady are manufactured from graphite and clay, the inside doesn’t really contain lead.  \nModern pencils were born in 16th Century England. In 1564, people in Borrowdale discovered a kind of black mineral called graphite. Like lead, graphite could leave marks on paper, and the marks it left were much darker than lead, thus, people called graphite “black lead”. Shepherds in the Borrowdale region commonly used graphite to mark seals on the bodies of sheep. Later, people carved lead into little strips, using them for writing and drawing. After long, the English king George the Second brought Borrowdale graphite ore back to the imperial household for the royal family’s particular use.   \nHowever, graphite strips also had their weak point: they dirty the hands, and they break easily. In 1761, German chemist Faber mixed graphite powder together with sulfer, pine resin and other things, and manufactured them as strips, which was much tougher than simple graphite, and didn’t dirty the hands as easily. At the end of the 18th century, only England and Germany were capable of producing pencils.    \nLater, France discovered [deposits of] graphite ore in their earth, but the ore’s quality wasn’t high, and the quantities weren’t great. French Scientist Conte mixed the ore with clay, fired it in a kiln, making a more easy to use and durable pencil wick. The amount of clay mixed with the graphite wasn’t always the same, and so the hardness of the lead [wick] also changed accordingly. We often see “B” and “HB” letters marked out on the head of the pencil, indicating hardness and light or darkness of color. “B” indicates color, H indicates hardness, therefore, “HB” indicates that hardness and darkness  of the lead are both moderate, and are suitable for writing.\n",

I’d put this in the lower-advanced spectrum, as the sentence structure isn’t over-the-top literary, but there are a ton of specialized words and proper nouns.\nThe tone is very encyclopedic, so, rather serious and not a lot of fun.\nA couple of proper names for you:\n巴罗代尔 – Borrowdale, England\n乔治二世 – George the Second (English King)\n法伯 – Eberhard Faber, a German chemist\n孔德 – Nicolas-Jacques Conté, French scientist\nSource: http://www.gushi365.com/info/9763.html\n",

Flakes of snow lightly danced like dandelions in the air, and after a while, the earth wore clothes of pure white. \nCute little bear incautiously sprained his ankle, and had to lie in bed all alone. Suddenly, from outside the window came the sound of lighthearted singing. Little bear looked out the window, and [saw that it was] Little Mouse and Little White Rabbit dancing and singing! The snow still held [impressions of] their cute little footprints. Little Bear was truly envious! But what could he do? Little Bear gave a deep sigh, and said aloud to himself: “Better get some more sleep, and maybe in my dream there will be a miracle!” \nSure enough, Little bear had a good dream. In his dream, an old man with a long beard came into his room. The old man fished a little bottle out of his pocket, and smilingly sprayed [some liquid from the bottle] on Little Bear’s wounded foot. Little Bear immediately leaped up and frisked about, playing cheerfully with his [two] buddies on the snowy ground.\nThe happy sounds of the small birds woke Little Bear up, and [found that] actually it was all just a dream. But then he discovered that there was a small bottle in his hand! Little Bear took up the small bottle and sprayed it on his foot, and the wounded foot was immediately better! This really was a bottle of magic water! After that, Little Bear never again feared bumps and bruises.\n",

    "summary": "Been a couple of months since I tossed a post out there – the latter half of 2013 was a bit of a shake-up, so please forgive the lapse. In other news, I can’t get my favorite Chinese story website, tom61.com, to load anymore, #sadface. Fingers crossed that’s a temporary glitch, but if not, I’ll mourn the loss of a fantastic learner’s website.\nIn the meantime, I’ve pulled something off gushi365.com.\nThe content of this story is for children, but the language is not beginner, and neither is the sentence structure – this is an intermediate read for sure. I say that because it feels very “fairy-tale” language-y, in the sense that sentences are formed in a more literary way, rather than in a chatty way, and there are some uncommonly-heard words, like “footprint” (脚印), etc. The tone of the story, on the other hand, is very tra-la-la, winter sparkly glitter magic.\nTwo quick notes on phrases here: 传来了 chuàn lái is an intermediate phrase that can be a little hard to understand, but it is used in reference to things we hear that come to us from afar. This may include voices (like hearing someone’s voice from outside your house), or noises, or smells, or a piece of news. You can use this to talk about sensations and things that come to you from no particular person or direction – from “afar” or “all around”.\n掏出 tāo chū: this means to fish something out of something else. For example, to fish your phone out of your pocket, or to fish your sweatshirt out of your backpack.\n",

    "englishText": "\nToday, it’s a great day for a picnic. Mr. Pig dressed himself with care, looking forward to [the possibility of] Miss Pig and himself going on a picnic together.\n“Heh, I hope she says ‘Yes’ [lit: I'm willing]. Hm, I’ll also pick some flowers to give her, that will certainly be enough to sway her!”\nOn the road, Mr. Pig ran into his friend Fox. When fox heard about the picnic, he said: “Let me give you a suggestion, let me lend you my beautiful tail. See, you look so clever, Miss Pig will certainly like it.” Mr. Pig was very pleased. \nContinuing on, he ran into his friend Lion. Lion heard about the picnic and said: “Let me give you a suggestion, borrow my beautiful hair for when you go over there. See, you look so powerful, Miss Pig will certainly like it.” Mr. Pig was very pleased.  \nAfter a while, he ran into his friend Zebra. Zebra heard about the picnic and said: “Let me give you a suggestion, I’ll lend you my beautiful stripes. See, you look so handsome. Miss Pig will certainly like it.” Mr. Pig was very pleased. He felt that he’d never before looked so handsome.\nFinally arriving at Miss Pig’s house, Mr. Pig excitedly knocked on the door. “Would you do me the honor of going on a picnic with me?” he asked. \nMiss Pig was terrified: “Oh, no way! What kind of monster are you? If you don’t go away, I’ll go get Mr. Pig, he’ll straighten you out!”\nMr. Pig hurriedly ran away. On the road, he gave the stripes back to Zebra, the hair back to Lion, and the tail back to Fox. AFter that, he hurried back to Miss Pig’s house, and again pressed the doorbell. \n“Would you do me the honor of having a picnic with me?” he asked again. \n“Goodness, Mr. Pig!” Miss Pig cried out. “I’m so happy to see you, I’d love to go on a picnic with you. An ugly wretch just came by here, standing in my garden, and scared me so.” \nOn the way, Miss Pig told Mr. Pig the story of the ‘ugly wretch’ in great detail. Her handsome friend Mr. Pig, though, listened with great sympathy. It really was a great day for a picnic.\n",

    "summary": "I love it when I find a longer story that’s suitable for beginning readers. This one, which is either a tale that reminds us what happens when you try to be something you’re not, or a tale that reminds us that men should never be allowed to give each other fashion advice, definitely fits the bill.\nThe first sentence isn’t super simple, so push through that one if you can, it gets much easier in the following paragraphs. Four points of grammar:\n能有幸请 néng yǒu xìng qǐng – A politely formal phrase of invitation “May have the pleasure of inviting you …” or more specifically, “May I be so lucky as to…” (have this dance?) (take you on a date?).\n看上去 kàn shàng qù – To look like.\n你要是再不走开 nǐ yào shì zài bù zǒu kāi – This one might be a little confusing. Let’s break it down:\n你 – You\n要是 – If\n再不 – Otherwise / If not\n走开 – Go away\nThe full phrase means “If you don’t go away….”\n他会来收拾你的 tā huì lái shōu shi nǐ de. In the story, Miss Pig says this to an unwelcome guest. The “他” in this case is Mr. Pig. The Beginners often learn the word “收拾”, meaning “to tidy up”. Usually, this means exactly what it sounds like, and applies to cleaning up a room or an apartment. In this case, it’s being used in kind of an action movie way, meaning “He’ll come over and deal with you!” or “He’ll come straighten you out!”. So Miss Pig is threatening the unwelcome guest, telling him that Mr. Pig will come over and beat him up.\nThe Chinese title is 猪先生去野餐\n",

    "summary": "Welp, I swore I would never do this again but I found this (and several other short stories) in Hainan Airlines’ in-flight magazine (I’m in Prague!) and couldn’t resist typing it up (as opposed to copy-pasting from an online source). I’ve checked and checked for typos, but I’m not always the best at that, so if you run across one, please comment.\nThis is one of those reads where the sentence structure is basic and in parts very repetitive, but quite a few advanced words are used – “advanced” only because they’re not used often in casual conversation, like parts of an animal (hooves, horns, etc.) So beginners, you can give this a go if you’re feeling very patient but you’ll be looking up every other word in some paragraphs even though you will be able to predict generally what the next few sentences are about.\nI wanted to post a quick comment about the words 一箭一般, because this looks like a typical four-character idiom, but it’s actually two separate words, 一箭 (an arrow) and 一般 (like, as if). Together this means “like an arrow”, or in context of this sentence “to take off (running) like a shot”.\nThere’s also the phrase 从草丛中闪出. We’re talking here about a dog that is “[darting] out in a flash” (闪出) “from the middle of a cluster of grasses” (从草丛中). We can imagine a dog charging out of a field of tall grass and into a clearing.\nThe Chinese title is 沉默的狗\n",

    "englishText": "\nMonkey went to the hospital on a lark, and entered the doctor’s room. At that moment, the doctor wasn’t in, and he’d left his [doctor's] clothes in the room.\nMonkey thought this would be fun, so he put on the doctor’s clothes, that white lab coat we see so often. Just then a little bear came to the hospital to see the doctor. This was the little bear’s first time at the hospital, and he didn’t know what hospitals were like [lit: didn't know the hospital situation]. All he knew was that doctors wear white lab coats. \nThe little bear had shown up at the hospital carrying a basket of peaches (this was the payment he had prepared to give to the doctor), and he happened to walk into the room where Monkey was. Little Bear didn’t know Monkey, but he recognized the white lab coat, so he asked Monkey to examine him.\nMonkey originally just [intended to] have a bit of fun, but when he saw Little Bear’s basket, he coveted it fiercely. So Monkey put on a big show of examining Little Bear, and accepted his well-earned basket of peaches. As to whether or not Monkey actually cured Little Bear, we will never know. \nHowever, after Monkey tasted that sweetness, he often stole into the hospital, taking advantage of the doctor’s absence, and examined patients. Later, Monkey simply made himself one of those kind of white lab coats. \nAi! We don’t know how many people were examined by Monkey!\n",

    "summary": "Eeps – bad medicine! In this story, the mischievous Monkey – always a trickster figure in Chinese stories – pulls the wool over Little Bear’s eyes. If Little Bear was American, he’d sue the hospital for negligence and rake in millions of baskets of peaches.\nThough the majority of this text is very basic reading, there are three phrases which jump out at me as being difficult, or words I couldn’t find in basic dictionaries.\n理所应当 – lǐ suǒ yīng dāng This phrase means to feel something is well-deserved, that something has been earned through hard work, usually when it actually hasn’t. So I guess that roughly translates to ‘taking a reward for granted’? In this story, Monkey feels that his payment is well-earned or well-deserved. But as readers, we know Monkey doesn’t deserve anything at all – he’s taking that payment for granted when he didn’t really earn it. Consider this phrase in another context:\n别人帮助你那是义气，你不能当作是理所应当的。 – “When other people help you it’s in the spirit of self-sacrifice, you shouldn’t consider this something you deserve as a matter of course.”\n甜头 – Though this looks like two words, the first meaning “sweet” and the second meaning “head” or “brain”, it’s actually a colloquialism that just means “sweet flavor” or “pleasant taste”.\n贪念 – These two characters also seem separate, they don’t appear together in my dictionary, but they’re actually one word. According to Baidu Bai Ke, the Baidu dictionary (a Chinese-language resource for word meanings and derivations), 贪念 tān niàn just means “greedy” (I presume the “念” probably adds the meaning “idea” or “thoughts” here, so 贪念 could be read as “greedy thoughts”).\nYou can read the original here.\n",

    "chineseText": "同学们，我的新家安电话的时侯还是几年前，可现在想起来可真是记忆犹新呀！不信？那我就讲给你听听，我可要出点丑了！\n“燃燃，你快点来呀，咱们家安电话了！”啊？什么？安了？其实，我家以前也安过电话，不过那个时侯安电话时，我还是个婴儿，根本不知道刚安电话后打电话的滋味，我早就想尝一尝啦！我迫不及待的向家门跑去。我进门时爸爸对我说：“燃燃，你不是说你想尝一尝刚安电话的时候打电话的滋味吗？快点来呀！”我拿起电话，像是没见过电话似的，盯着电话看了老半天，仔细打量着这部电话来：绿色的机身，0——9的电话号码整齐的排列着……“还愣着干嘛？快打呀！”爸爸催我。我想：这第一次打该打给谁呢？打给我的好朋友王钰涵，让她分享我打电话的喜悦？打给亲朋好友让他们来我家玩？不，我要打给老师。“8-5-8-6-1-1-5-8”爸爸告诉我老师的电话。“8-5-8-6-1-1-8-5”通了。“老师，我是李燃，我家安了电话，我以后……”“小朋友，你打错了，我不是你老师。”“啊？”\n我的心跳得更厉害了。\n",
    "englishText": "\nFellow students, [though] it was several years ago when our new home installed a telephone, but when I think of it now it’s still fresh in my memory! Don’t believe me? Then I’ll give you a listen [to my story], and my shame will be apparent! \n“Ranran, come quickly, we’ve installed a telephone!” Oh? What? Installed one? Actually we had a phone before, but when we had the phone installed, I was still an infant, and I didn’t know the feeling of making a call after the phone had been installed, but I’d always wanted a taste! I impatiently ran back towards the door of the house. When I entered the door, dad said to me “Ranran, didn’t you say you wanted to taste the experience [lit: flavor] of using the phone when it had been installed? Come quick!” I picked up the phone, as if I’d never seen a phone before, and stared at the phone for [what seemed like] half a day, carefully sizing it up: it had a green casing, and the numbers 0-9 were arrayed in neat rows. “What are you doing just standing there? Quick, make a call!” papa urged me. I thought: who should my first telephone call be to?  Should I call my good friend Wang Yu Han, and let her share the joy of a phone call? Call close friends and family and tell them to come over to my house and play? No, I want to call my teacher. “8-5-8-6-1-1-5-8″, dad told me teachers phone number. [The call to] “8-5-8-6-1-1-8-5″ went through. “Teacher, this is Li Ran, we just installed a telephone, after this I…” “Little friend, you dialed the wrong number, I’m not your teacher.” “Huh?” \nMy heart pounded violently.\n",

    "summary": "Though the conclusion of this essay might fall a bit flat for all of us who are very used to having a telephone, this is an interesting glimpse into what a monumental rite of passage it is for children in rural areas to have one or use one for the first time.\nA confusing word (and an important and often-repeated one) in this text might be 安. We know this word most commonly means “peace”. But the author keeps saying 安电话. This does not, contrary to appearances, mean “peace phone”. In this case, 安 is the shorter version of 安装 ān zhuāng, meaning “to install”. So, 安电话 means “to install a phone”.\nThere are also a few proper names in here, which we’ll point out early: 燃燃 is the author’s name, when the author is addressed by a loved one (typically who is older than them). 李燃 is the author’s actual full name. You can see from this that family members and close friends will sometimes take a Chinese person’s given name (which as we know, comes last, and in this case is 燃), and double it as a form of endearment. So 李燃 becomes 燃燃 to close friends and family. This isn’t always the case but you’ll see it a lot. It is inappropriate to address a Chinese person this way unless you know them very well, and you should never address an elder this way. It’s considered very cutesy. Another proper name is 王钰涵 wáng yù hán, the author’s best friend mentioned in passing.\nIn several instances, the author also mentions the “滋味” of using a phone. 滋味 literally means “flavor” or “taste” (noun). In English, we’d probably substitute the word “feeling”.\nAnd a final grammar note on the phrase: 像是没见过电话似的. Pay attention to the 像 – it’s attached to the 似的 at the end. Together, wrapped around a phrase, these characters mean “as if…” or “like…”. This phrase means “… as if I had never seen a phone before”.\nHere’s the original text of 第一次打电话\n",

        "Fellow students, [though] it was several years ago when our new home installed a telephone, but when I think of it now it’s still fresh in my memory! Don’t believe me? Then I’ll give you a listen [to my story], and my shame will be apparent! ",
        "“Ranran, come quickly, we’ve installed a telephone!” Oh? What? Installed one? Actually we had a phone before, but when we had the phone installed, I was still an infant, and I didn’t know the feeling of making a call after the phone had been installed, but I’d always wanted a taste! I impatiently ran back towards the door of the house. When I entered the door, dad said to me “Ranran, didn’t you say you wanted to taste the experience [lit: flavor] of using the phone when it had been installed? Come quick!” I picked up the phone, as if I’d never seen a phone before, and stared at the phone for [what seemed like] half a day, carefully sizing it up: it had a green casing, and the numbers 0-9 were arrayed in neat rows. “What are you doing just standing there? Quick, make a call!” papa urged me. I thought: who should my first telephone call be to?  Should I call my good friend Wang Yu Han, and let her share the joy of a phone call? Call close friends and family and tell them to come over to my house and play? No, I want to call my teacher. “8-5-8-6-1-1-5-8″, dad told me teachers phone number. [The call to] “8-5-8-6-1-1-8-5″ went through. “Teacher, this is Li Ran, we just installed a telephone, after this I…” “Little friend, you dialed the wrong number, I’m not your teacher.” “Huh?” ",

I still remember clearly, that day, I quietly stole your box of cigarettes, and secretly threw them in the trash can, because I was thinking that would stop you from smoking. But who knew, when you returned, and you found out your cigarettes were gone, you rummaged through everything looking for them. When I told you, that it was me who threw them away, you were quite angry, and you ruthlessly scolded me, You bad child! That sentence made me [lit: 'the me of that time'] feel great pain. I locked myself in my room, and at that time in my heart I thought, You big opium pipe! [Then go ahead and] smoke, smoke, smoke until you die and I won’t care [lit: I won't pay any attention to you].\nPapa, please don’t smoke! I always find that when you go to work, your box of cigarettes is still full of cigarettes, but when you get off work and come back, there are only a few cigarettes left in the box. Every time I see you you’re surrounded by a curling cloud [of smoke], there’s a sour smell in my nose. I worry that your lungs have already been riddled with gaping wounds by the nicotine. \nPapa, please don’t smoke! You cough every day, and every day you expectorate. I worry that you will leave us. When you abandon us, then what will we do? \nPapa, for your health, and for us, please don’t smoke!\n",

    "summary": "In this essay, a child desperately (and very angrily) pleads their father not to smoke. Though this is classified as “Intermediate”, beginners should definitely try this read, leaning heavily on the hover word-list. The difficult parts are the mid-level turns of phrase, which are all explained below.\nCouple of grammar points. First of all: 我本想让您别抽烟. Most of this sentence is quite simple, but the addition of the character 本 can be puzzling, especially since 本 has many meanings. In this case, the word 本 means “originally”, as in “I originally thought to let you not smoke.” Or, in better English, “My original intention was that this would make you stop smoking.”\nAnother point: When the father learns that his cigarettes are gone, he 东翻西找. This phrase is actually a mixture of two words: 东西 (east and west / left and right / in all directions) and 翻找 (to rummage through things while searching, turn things over). We’ve seen this kind of thing before in previous posts, as with the phrase “仰起头来” in the post Little Dog Wears Shoes. If you let the mental picture kind of wash over you, you get an image of the father turning things over looking for his cigarettes.\nA word of interest: 大烟枪. Literally, this word means “big opium pipe” or in more contemporary times can actually mean “big bong”. Colloquially in reference to a person, this means “someone who smokes a lot”, a “heavy smoker”.\nThe Chinese title is: 爸爸请您别抽烟了, and the original is here.\n",

When I told you, that it was me who threw them away, you were quite angry, and you ruthlessly scolded me, You bad child! That sentence made me [lit: 'the me of that time'] feel great pain. I locked myself in my room, and at that time in my heart I thought, You big opium pipe!

    "englishText": "\nIn the beginning of the 19th century, a businessman from Holland was in his office when he suddenly noticed, [painted on] the wrapping paper of some porcelain, a beautiful portrait, the pose both vivid and lifelike, but it was unlike any of the Western portraits he had seen. Clearly this completely revolutionary work of art deeply attracted him, and he turned over every piece of porcelain wrapping paper, discovering that all of them were painted with a colorful, bright and beautiful scene, each one different. From then on, the businessman took to the road seeking this type of Japanese wood cut painting. At that time, this type of woodcut was actually quite cheap, and easy to collect. When he took these collector’s items out and exhibited them, it practically stunned all the visitors. These Japanese woodcut paintings are “Ukiyo-e”. These woodcuts had a deep and lasting influence on the European art world, so much so that when anyone raises the topic of ukiyo-e, the first association that comes to mind is pornography, the second is Van Gogh and Impressionism.\n",

    "summary": "Thanks to Sina Weibo, China’s most popular blog network, I stumbled across this neat art blog, which I recommend taking a stab at if you like art, as you’ll learn a bunch of useful simplified Chiense artist vocabulary. This post discusses the fable-like origins of Ukiyo-e, a traditional style of Japanese art. The Chinese for “Ukiyo-e” is 浮世绘, or “Floating world paintings”.\nFor me, the hardest part of this read was the following phrase, which seems to make sense on its own, but makes little sense in the context of the sentence: 不用于往日视觉经验的. By itself, this says “no use (不用) in looking to days past (于往日) for this visual experience (视觉经验的)”. Okay, fair enough. But the full sentence is: 显然这种全然不用于往日视觉经验的作品深深的吸引了他. We’ve got the beginning of the sentence (显然这种全然) – this means “Obviously this type of completely…”. And we’ve got the end of the sentence (作品深深的吸引了他), which means “works of art deeply attracted him.” But when we add the middle bit, the sentence no longer seems clear: “Obviously this type of completely [no use in looking to days past for this visual experience] work of art deeply attracted him.\nWhat?\nI’m told by my Chinese friend that this language is pretty rare, but turns out, the middle phrase is just a way of describing just how different from other things this Ukiyo-e actually was. There’s “no use consulting the past” to re-live this experience, because the experience (seeing the work of art) has never been had before (by the person viewing). (Anyone with input, please feel free to add to this in the comments).\nIf I were to write that sentence in English, I’d replace that phrase with “revolutionary” – “Obviously this type of completely revolutionary artwork deeply attracted him” – but the word “revolutionary” in Chinese tends to call up a lot of other associations that aren’t relevant in this context.\nI’ve only translated the first paragraph here. Here’s the original post, if you care to finish it on your own. The original post has the best pictures.\n",

        "19世纪初，一位荷兰商人在他的办公室里发现了他的日本瓷器包装纸上居然有一副美人肖像，姿态传神生动，但是却不同于他见过的所有西方肖像。显然这种全然不用于往日视觉经验的作品深深的吸引了他，他翻出了所有的瓷器包装纸，发现它们上面都有着色彩亮丽，内容各异的画面。从此以后，商人开始寻求这种日本版画之路。当时这类版画可谓是价格低廉，便于收藏。当他把这些藏品拿出来展览之时，几乎震撼了所有的来宾。这批日本版画就是“浮世绘”。这些版画对欧洲的画坛产生了深远的印象，以至于现在大家提起浮世绘，第一想到的是色情，第二想到的就是梵高和印象派。"

    "summary": "Father’s Day’s coming up in a few weeks, and we’ll be looking at the lyrics of a beginner-level saccharine-cute song written for children to sing to their dads (or, for the children of the digital generation, to forward to their dads) on their special day. This post is accompanied by a Flash Father’s Day video where you can listen to the song on an INFINITE LOOP. Lucky you. \n\nHere’s the original video with the actual song. http://new.060s.com/flash/flashbrow.php?flash=70648ecb985590c987c8ffd9b0b5edb1, have a listen if you dare.\nBecause this is a song, we have a couple of instances where a similar sentence structure is used with different words – these are probably the hardest sentences in the song. Example: 脏活累活他全包了. First, let me break down this sentence:\n脏 – Dirty\n活 – Activity, work\n累 – Tired\n活 – Activity, work\n他 – He\n全包 – All included\n了 – (grammar word)\nWhat? Dirty activity tired activity he all included?! What the heck does that mean? In proper English, we might translate that as “Dirty work, Tired work, he does it all!” We are, of course, talking about our amazing dads and all the thanklessly exhausting housework and job work they do. Thing is, there’s nowhere in this sentence where the verb “does” as in “to do work” actually appears. We’re just expected to infer the word from the context of 全包 – “all included”.\nWe see the same sentence structure later in the song: 剩菜剩饭他全包了. The breakdown:\n剩 – Leftover\n菜 – Vegetables\n剩 – Leftover\n饭 – Rice\n他 – He\n全包 – All included\n了 (grammar word).\nOnce again, that strange “all included” – we are again expected to infer the verb here. Any guesses? The sentence means “Leftover Vegetables, Leftover Rice, he eats it all!” or “He eats all the leftovers!” So the missing word we kinda have to mentally fill in is “eats”.\n",

In this recipe post by blogger Rosie Zhao, we learn how to make cake in a rice cooker (bless you, Rosie, bless you). This is particularly relevant if you live in China, the land of no ovens. You can find the original post, with delicious cake-filled pictures, here.\nRosie says: “Since living in China I’ve become more and more interested in learning to cook western food from scratch. I want to try to recreate some of my favorites from back home in the U.S. I am trying to post some recipes in both English and Chinese on my blog in hopes that other expats as well as Chinese locals will give them a try. This recipe is my own and translated into Chinese with the help of my husband.“\n",

    "englishText": "\nCarrying a heavy load on my back, holding the exam papers that were just handed back to us, I wondered how I could make my father sign this paper……\nThe exam, which was held just two days before, was handed back to us. I got an A+, a high score of 97 points! All the students in my class were envious of me, and I got the praise of my teacher. But when we were asked to do corrections, I found myself dropping all the way from heaven to hell. I actually forgot to do a whole page of questions, and had to be deducted of ten marks! But my teacher hadn’t discovered yet, and I wasn’t sure if I had to say it to her. I was in two minds. One said, “Don’t tell her, otherwise you would lose face and lose your father’s present!” The other said, “No, you should be honest, just tell her!” So, I said, “I missed these questions, the actual points should be 87!” When she helped me change my score, I heaved a sigh of relief.\nWhen I was going home, I wished I had not said all that. Now, not only was I going to lose my father’s present, but I was also going to be scolded by him. At night, when I passed my paper to him, he said,”Why were you so careless? Why did you miss out a whole page of questions?” Usually, when he asks me all these questions, I call him a “dad of ten-thousand questions”. But now, I daren’t, because he seems so angry that he might hit me. Suddenly, when he saw that my 97 points became 87 points, he asked me,”What happened?” I told him the truth, and lowered my head, ready to continue being scolded.\nMy father silenced for a while. Then he suddenly said, “No, darling, even though you results aren’t satisfactory, in life’s exam, you have gotten a high score. I am proud of you! You have done it right……” after saying that he signed his name.\nThe next morning, carrying my schoolbag, with light steps, I was feeling happy. Welcoming the rising sun, I walked towards my school with confidence……\n",

    "summary": "Well well well, lookie here. A guest post! Today we’ll be reading Rebecca Chua’s (Chinese name: 蔡幸彤) translation of an essay from her textbook. The post is about the rewards of honesty. I remember my own textbook being full of these types of essays, so thank you, Rebecca, for the traditional read.\nRebecca has this to say about the post: This story talks about a school-going child’s problems of getting his parents to sign his papers. It also talks about being honest, and that life’s exam papers matter the most. This essay was from my tutoring centre’s teaching materials. This was done with help. Thank you for those who helped me!\n(And the same in Chinese:) 这个故事是讲述华文考试卷要签名所遇到的困难。这个故事教我们要诚实，也教我们，虽然考卷的真正分数低，但人生的考卷上有高分才是最重要的。\nOne of the interesting things about this post is the punctuation. In Chinese, they use a six-dot ellipses …… where we only use… three. (u c wat i did thar?). We also learn a little culture here: it’s worth noting that in most Chinese highschools, parents actually have to sign your test results to prove you showed it to them. We also see that Rebecca’s book spells “A+” as “A*”.\nI’m super loving this phrase – 从天堂降落到地狱 – though it might need a little breakdown:\n从 – From\n天堂 – Heaven\n降落 – descend\n到 – to\n地狱 – Hell\nThis phrase means to “have a sinking heart” or to “fall from joy to misery”.\n",

    "englishText": "\nThere once was a man who lost his axe, and though he searched all over for it he still couldn’t find it. After a while he thought it must have been that the neighbor’s son stole it, so he began to take note of the child’s expressions, words and actions and thought they were all those of a thief. Thus, he concluded that it was the neighbor’s kid that stole it, and in his heart he said, “I always thought that guy was no good.” \nOn the second day, when he went up the mountain to chop firewood and at the side of a tree he found his lost axe. Now he finally remembered that he’d actually forgotten it there two days before. He regretted casually suspecting his neighbor’s child. After he returned home, he took another look at the child’s behavior, words and actions, and he didn’t seem at all like a person who would steal anything. So he said, “I’ve always thought that [that kid] is not the kind of person who would steal”. 　 　　\nAfter this, people have used the phrase “Lose the Axe and Suspect the Neighbor” to describe inventing subjective feelings and careless suspicions.\n",

    "summary": "Been a little while since I posted, I’ve been a bit wrapped up in my new iPad app, Hanzi Reader, which is, may I say, amazing for reading practice. It’s very much like this site, except you can choose any Chinese text you like, copy-paste it into the reader, the reader analyses the text. After the analysis is complete, pushing any word in the text pops up an English and pinyin translation – truly a wonderful reading tool.\nThe “Story Behind the Idiom” posts are my favorite to put up, they’re not only helpful in remember idioms, they’re usually pretty interesting to read. This one is a lower intermediate text.\nAt the end of the first paragraph, the protagonist says, ““我早就看出那个家伙不是个好东西。” This translates to “I always thought that guy was no good.” But why use the term “东西”, or “thing”, instead of “person”? In Chinese, when you refer to a person as 东西, or “thing”, this is a form of insult. In English, an equivalent might be the phrase “you worthless thing!” So we can understand from the use of the word 东西 in this sentence that the protagonist really doesn’t like the person he’s speaking about.\n",

    "summary": "Hey hey! This site has made it through two years online and 100 posts! That makes an average of 50 posts a year, which averages out to a little less than one a week. Not terribly shabby, huh? In any case, on with the Chinese.\nI’ve been having a bit of trouble rounding up truly beginner texts, and whenever I try I end up with an intermediate post. But this one, though not earth-shattering, should certainly do. We’ve got three short jokes here of the silly variety, appropriate for young kids.\nThough we could probably skip this info, you might want to know that 晨练 – meaning “morning exercise” – is a much more formalized concept in China than in west. Here, every morning in almost any weather, crowds of old people gather together in parks around 6-7a.m. to do group taiqi, stretch and take brisk walks. This is so prevalent that you can show up at any park or open community space in China early in the morning and see groups of mostly old people doing their exercises. So, while reading the first joke, you should imagine a scene of 40 or so retirees doing taiqi forms in the park.\n",

    "summary": "You know you need a KTV song! Beijing, Beijing is a slow ballad sung by Chinese artist 汪峰 wāng fēng and was in the Baidu Top 100 top 10 for a bit this year. Now it looks like it’s fallen between the 30th and 40th place on various music charts, but it’s still pretty popular, particularly in, you know, Beijing. If you can find it in yourself to embrace the painful 80′s growly I-mean-it man voice and the “Streets of Philadelphia” emo-dad thing, you may find that the song is a good karaoke song if you’re just starting out because it’s repetitive, it’s not abstract, it’s sung slowly enough to sing along and it’s so emotionally over-fraught that it’s fun.\n\nI recommend you read and translate the lyrics before you listen to the song, so you’ve got an idea of what you’re hearing.\nA few translation notes: it’s not always clear exactly how to translate song lyrics. Example: 寻找着追逐着奄奄一息的碎梦 is not an easy lyric to translate. Or rather, it’s super easy to get the gist of the meaning (searching, chasing, dying, broken dreams… you get the idea), but put an “of” in the wrong place and the meaning changes to something slightly different. I’ve done my best, feel free to re-write or re-interpret those in a different way.\n",

All he thinks about all day is eating, he’ll soon turn into a pig,” I say. \n“Stinky LeLe, saying I’ll turn into a pig.

One time, [paternal] grandmother was talking with me, saying that older brother eats enough for four people in a single sitting. When he was small it was absolutely no problem for him to polish off two bowls of egg cake in a sitting, even three bowls is just a small appetizer to him. If it was me that ate that much, the person writing this essay would have long ago become a “stuffed devil”.\nOlder brother is always snatching my food and eating it.

When I was done showering, I found that there wasn’t a trace [of food] left in my bowl, but my brother was off to one side burping with satisfaction, turns out my brother stole my food and ate it.

    "summary": "Chinese Title: 贪吃的哥哥\nHah! I set out to do a beginner post since I haven’t done one in a while, but no joy, I think I have to classify this as intermediate. Beginners are welcome to try this out, as most of the words are simple and the subject matter is a bit immature (so of course it totally cracked me up), but the issue is that this essay is written by a kid making fun of her older brother for eating too much, and the sentence structure reads like a playground taunt – it sounds like the author used this essay assignment as an opportunity to get back at her brother for something. So it’s very casually written and the sentence structure isn’t book-formal enough to be smooth reading for newbies. Still, if you can get most of the words, which aren’t too hard, you’ll get the drift.\nAn example of just such an easy-to-figure-out colloquialism is “不嘛,” which means something along the lines of “Nuh-uh!” or “No!” (as in the way a child starts off an argumentative sentence with “No it’s not!” or “No it isn’t!”)\nA few things I should cover right out the gate: 红烧排骨和猪蹄 is the name of a dish. 红烧 is a way of cooking a dish where food is slowly simmered in an oily red sauce. On Chinese menus you’ll often see 红烧 followed by many different things. One of my favorites is 红烧茄子 – Eggplant Simmered in Red Sauce. So this dish, 红烧排骨和猪蹄, is spare ribs (排骨) and pig feet (猪蹄) simmered in red sauce (红烧).\nOne of the more difficult sentences here is 要是换成我吃那么多的话，现在写作文的早就是个饱死鬼了 – there are multiple points of difficulty here.\nLet’s break this one down a bit. In the previous sentence, the author is talking about how much her brother can eat. Then she says, 要是换成我吃那么多的话 – the hard part of this is 换成, which means “to switch”, or in this case “to switch positions with someone”. In other words “If (要是) I switched positions (换成) with my brother (‘with my brother’ is implied, not said), and it was me that ate so much (我吃那么多)”…\nThe sentence continues: 现在写作文的早就是个饱死鬼了. I think the hard part of this is the way 的 is used. Beginning readers expect 的 to either follow a word to make it possessive (我的, 他的）, or to show that something’s being described (“红色的箱子”). In this case, the author actually left out the word being described, which is 人. This part could also be written 现在写作文的人: or in other words “the person writing this essay right now…” This is a very informal way of talking. We continue: 早就是个饱死鬼了 “Long ago (早) would have become (就是个…了) a full devil (饱死鬼 – someone who has eaten until they are overstuffed – google image result for 饱死鬼 gets us this).\nSo all together: “If I was the one who’d eaten that much, the person writing this essay [me] would have long ago become overstuffed.”\nAnd one last thing: the older brother at one point calls the author 臭乐乐. I understand this translates to “Stinky Lele!”, so we can assume here that “Lele” is the author’s name. This is probably a girl’s name, so we assume the author is female.\n",

    "englishText": "\nThis Christmas season, America is suffering through a blizzard, which has already caused at least 15 deaths and the delay or cancellation of 2000 flights. \nAccording to reports, the snowstorm and bitter cold has caused deaths in states including Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Pennsylvania and Virginia. \nMany regions issued warnings reminding people not to go outside, because the biting cold, howling winds, low temperatures and dangerous traffic conditions compose a threat to pedestrians. The weather department said that severe snow will soon appear in America’s northeastern New England area, with snowfall in Maine reaching 18 inches (about 45 centimeters). As a result, many people’s Christmas travel plans will be effected.\nCurrently, 200,000 homes have already experienced electrical outages, and tens of thousands of travelers have been detained.

    "summary": "Chinese Title: 暴风雪已致15人死 2000航班延误取消\nIn the spirit of the holiday season, which is winding to a blissfully overweight close, I give you an article about something you may or may not have just struggled through if you flew home for the holidays (which I did).\nThis is a wildly factual article about the congestion caused by the snow storms a week or so ago. Not a lot of excitement here, mostly a tallying up of what a big fat mess the American aviation system becomes during the annual Christmas hysteria.\nLots and lots of proper nouns in here, including lots of U.S. states, some cities and even a couple of basketball team names. Probably the most fun you’ll have reading this is trying to decipher the list of Chinese names for U.S. states (read the characters out loud quickly and see if you can guess – example: 弗吉尼亚州 fo ji ni ya = Virginia). You can always tell you’re reading a U.S. state name because the character 州 appears at the tail end of each state.\n",

Because it was the largest kingdom in the near area, the Yelang king who’d never left his own country thought the country he ruled was the biggest on earth. \nOne day, the king of Yelang was on a national border inspection tour with his troops, when he pointed in front of him [to neighboring country] and said, “Which country is bigger?” In order to serve their own interests and make the king happy, the troops said, “Of course Yelang is bigger!” They walked along, and the king once again lifted up his head, gazed at the big mountain in the distance and asked: “Is there a taller mountain than this anywhere on earth?” And his men answered: “No, there’s no mountain taller than this one on earth.” After a while, they reached the river side, and the king asked again: “I think this is the world’s longest river.” And all his men said in unison “The king speaks truly.” After this, the ignorant king believed even more firmly that Yelang was the world’s biggest country.\nThen one day, the Han Dynasty dispatched an envoy to Yelang, and en route they encountered the neighboring kingdom DianGuo, and the King of Dian asked the emissary: “If you compared the Han Dynasty and my Kingdom, which one would be bigger?” The emissary listened in astonishment, as he’d never have thought this small a country thought it could compare itself to the Han Dynasty. But he really never could have suspected that when he got to Yelang, the prideful and ignorant king who didn’t know that the kingdom he ruled was about the size of one Han county, would ask with an exaggerated opinion of his own worth, “Which is bigger: the Han Dynasty or my country?”\n",

    "summary": "Chinese Title: 夜郎自大\nHere we’ll cover the back story behind the idiom “夜郎自大”, or “Yelang thinks highly of itself”. This idiom one refers to someone who has a high, but misguided, opinion of their own worth. Stick this one in the language bank for when you need to take someone down a peg (preferably while stroking your fu manchu and calmly catching flies with your chopsticks).\nI learned a new word on this one: 统治 tǒng zhì. Which brings the total number of “tongzhi” words (tonal differences aside) I know up to three.\nWe’ve got:\n同志 – tóng zhì or “Comrade” (and in Chinese slang this also means “a homosexual”, though if you keep an eye on the Chinese news you’ll see that that one of the more reputable local dictionaries refused to include that definition though it’s in common use)\n通知 [pinyin1]tong1 zhi1[/pinyin] – To notify, give notice\nAnd now, 统治 tǒng zhì – To rule over (a kingdom / country)\nLet us hope there aren’t any more configurations of that sound.\n",

        "During the Han Dynasty, in the southwest there was a small country called Yelang, and although it was an independent nation, its territory was small, there weren’t many citizens, and its products were pitifully few. Because it was the largest kingdom in the near area, the Yelang king who’d never left his own country thought the country he ruled was the biggest on earth. ",
        "One day, the king of Yelang was on a national border inspection tour with his troops, when he pointed in front of him [to neighboring country] and said, “Which country is bigger?” In order to serve their own interests and make the king happy, the troops said, “Of course Yelang is bigger!” They walked along, and the king once again lifted up his head, gazed at the big mountain in the distance and asked: “Is there a taller mountain than this anywhere on earth?” And his men answered: “No, there’s no mountain taller than this one on earth.” After a while, they reached the river side, and the king asked again: “I think this is the world’s longest river.” And all his men said in unison “The king speaks truly.” After this, the ignorant king believed even more firmly that Yelang was the world’s biggest country.",
        "Then one day, the Han Dynasty dispatched an envoy to Yelang, and en route they encountered the neighboring kingdom DianGuo, and the King of Dian asked the emissary: “If you compared the Han Dynasty and my Kingdom, which one would be bigger?” The emissary listened in astonishment, as he’d never have thought this small a country thought it could compare itself to the Han Dynasty. But he really never could have suspected that when he got to Yelang, the prideful and ignorant king who didn’t know that the kingdom he ruled was about the size of one Han county, would ask with an exaggerated opinion of his own worth, “Which is bigger: the Han Dynasty or my country?”"

        "有一天，夜郎国国王与部下巡视国境的时候，他指着前方问说：“这里哪个国家最大呀？”部下们为了迎合国王的心意，于是就说：“当然是夜郎国最大啰！”走着走着，国王又抬起头来、望着前方的高山问说：“天底下还有比这座山更高的山吗？”部下们回答说：“天底下没有比这座山更高的山了。”后来，他们来到河边，国王又问：“我认为这可是世界上最长的河川了。”部下们仍然异口同声回答说：“大王说得一点都没错。”从此以后，无知的国王就更相信夜郎是天底下最大的国家。",

In the wake of [current] social development, the continuous increase in the number of policewomen and the continuous expansion in the scope of police work, policewomen have become an extraordinary force in upholding law and order and cracking down on crime.  [At the same time,] this development has left policewomen faced with difficulties in [maintaining] work-life balance.

On the other hand, [there are personal issues such as the fact that] the frenetic pace of police work makes it almost impossible to play a proper role in domestic life, creating an intense inner conflict in [policewomen's] heart.

This is an abstract of an academic paper from the Gender Studies Network authored by Zhou Ying.\nBecause this is an advanced academic abstract, you can really see how, in the upper levels of written Chinese, a ton of words that we find essential in English can be dropped from a sentence while still preserving the essence of the meaning. We tend to extend sentences with explanation, but here, I feel, is a fabulous example of how efficient Chinese can be. Because so many words have been dropped, I’ve added a whole lot of bracketed explanation and English fill-in words in the translation to better illuminate the implied meaning.\nI’m not quite sure I know what a “proper role in domestic life is”, I’m fairly certain that not all policewomen feel intensely conflicted, but I do like the idea of implementing some social policies to better support working women.\n",

    "summary": "I’ve been idly looking at moving to a new apartment lately (looks like I won’t be moving after all – a good thing, too, because I like my current place), and I typically use the Chinese property search sites instead of the foreign ones. The prices are about 4 times as high on the English sites made for foreigners, and the properties they offer there are often aimed at high-rolling executives. It helps quite a bit to be able to browse the Chinese listings, so I’m doing a few here. This is solidly advanced stuff. Local place names abound, so you have to be able to at least guess when something is or isn’t a proper noun, and because we’re working with real estate classifieds, a few words are shortened to save space or the formal version is used to sound professional.\nOne thing to bear in mind if you’re actually looking for an apartment in China is that quite a few of the pictures are fake, are from other houses in the same compound, or if you’re dealing with an agency, you should know that most places online have been rented already, but the agencies have left the ads up in hopes you’ll call them anyway and they can show you something else.\nYou really do have to go hunt around in person in China, but online apartment hunting can give you a few valuable pieces of info: what types of apartments are available in which areas (only old buildings? skyrises? hutong-houses?), which complexes are newer and have nicer amenities, and what apartments in a particular area usually go for.\nHere are three of the best and most popular Beijing real estate websites, if you want to practice on your own:\nbj.58.com/zufang/\nbeijing.anjuke.com\nzu.soufun.com/\nI’m going to list and translate a few different Beijing listings here, but I won’t link to the original listings as I imagine they’ll come down fairly fast, so I’ll just show a couple of photos. You can visit the links above for similar stuff. I’m taking some examples from a little spectrum: one crappy (and very very typical) older apartment near Beijing, a cheaper and nicer apartment in the distant suburbs of Beijing, a high-rolling super luxury apartment city-center, and a traditional-style siheyuan home.\nYou’ll see a lot of similarities between real estate and property listings in Beijing or anywhere, but a couple of major points of local flavor:\n押一付三　- This indicates how rent is paid. In Beijing, rent is not paid monthly. It can either be paid every three months, every six months, or you can pay the whole year in advance. This indicates rent is to be paid every 3 months (付三), which is by far the most common way to pay, and that a one-month deposit will be required (押一).\n朝向南北 – Man, the Chinese sure do care which way their apartment faces. People here will flat-out turn down an east/west facing place if they can afford to. The best apartments, apparently, face south / north, so you get sun all day, but it’s not blasting in your windows. Less ideal is when a place faces east / west – and people here care SO MUCH about this, that you can get a cheaper place if you don’t care that it faces east/west (though for haggling purposes, you’re better off pretending you do care). This is why the direction is front and center.\n",

    "chineseText": "我非常喜欢过新年，因为过年不但能穿新衣服，玩得快活，而且还能收到很多的压岁钱。今年我一下子就收到了700余元压岁钱，我拿着压岁钱，心里特别高兴，但是也很扫兴，怕妈妈给收走了，以往的压岁钱都要上缴的，我就给妈妈商量：今年我刚满十岁，我已经长大了，希望这些压岁钱由我来保管，没想到妈妈很爽快的答应了，我心里乐的开了花。我拿到这些压岁钱，我应该怎样来花这些钱呢？买我喜欢的玩具、还有我最喜欢吃的肯德基？我苦思冥想了好几天，我打算用这些钱来买我喜欢的书籍、买一些学习用品或者订报纸、献爱心捐款……除了这些,我是决不乱花的。\n我觉得这样做，不但可以从小学会勤俭节约、不乱花钱的习惯，而且还可以使我学会管理、学会生活，这样才会使我逐渐成长起来。\n",
    "englishText": "\n I really love New Year, because [during] New Year I can not only wear new clothes, and play happily, but also I can get a lot of New Year’s money. This year in a short while I got more than 700 yuan, and holding that New Years’ money, in my heart I was extremely happy, but also my spirits were dampened, I was afraid mama would take it away from me, [because] in the past [I had to] give over my New Year’s money to the higher authorities [author means his mother here, not God], so I discussed it with mom [thus]: this year I’m fully 10 years old, I’m already a grown up, and I hope this New Year’s money can be left under my care, but I never though she’d agree so easily [lit: so frankly], and happiness bloomed in my heart like a flower. I held the New Year’s money, but what should I spend this money on? Buy a toy I like, or my favorite thing to eat, Kentucky Fried Chicken? I racked my brains for several days, and decided to use the money to buy some books I liked, buy a few school supplies or to subscribe to a newspaper, and to make a charitable donation… apart from these things, I figured I’d better not spend it recklessly [author likely means they won't spend the rest at all].  \nI though that doing it this way, I not only could learn to be diligent and thrifty starting in primary school, and develop careful spending habits, but also this could let me study money management, study life [skills], and this would finally let me gradually mature.\n",

    "summary": "Chinese Title: 拿到压岁钱以后\nFor those of you new to Chinese culture, one thing a Chinese child most looks forward to all year is the time during Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) when they get to go ask their neighbors and other adults for red envelopes containing some money – it’s a bit like trick-or-treating for cash. This essay is about what happened to one kid’s Spring Festival haul. We’ll cover a lot of beginner grammar here.\nI should probably talk about a couple of points before we dive in. One is the use of the word 玩. Describing what he (or she, perhaps) does on Chinese New Year, the author says he can 玩得快活 – “play happily”. The Chinese don’t use “play” the way we do. While they do use it to mean “to play with toys” as a child does, they also use it to mean going out (like adults going out on Saturday night), or friends going out to a mall to go shopping – it’s really more of a blanket term better translated as “having fun”. So the kid is not saying they necessarily only play with toys happily on Chinese New Year, but also maybe that they go hang out at parents’ friends houses, or whatever. It’s not specified.\nAnother interesting point comes in here: 心里特别高兴，但是也很扫兴 – “In my heart I was extremely happy, but also very disappointed”. Note the use of the words 特别 and 很 – meaning “extremely” / “very” respectively. Thing is, in Chinese you can’t use a word like “happy” or “disappointed” without balancing it with a word measuring how happy or disappointed you were. There’s no way in general casual conversation to say “I was happy” – just regular ol’ happy. You can’t, for example, say just “我高兴“. Instead, say “I was VERY happy” 我很高兴, or “extremely happy” 我非常高兴 or “exceedingly happy” 高兴极了 or “fairly happy” 比较高兴 or whatever. So when we translate Chinese, we could actually drop the “very”s and “extremely”s and all that, because they have much less meaning in Mandarin then they do to us. This used to bug me a lot when speaking. I didn’t want to say I was “very happy” – I wasn’t. I was just normally happy. But it was finally explained to me how little that “very” actually mattered. So bear that in mind.\nAnd another point: …收到了700余元… This means “received over 700 yuan”. Notice that the word 余, which means “over” / “more than” is written after the amount of money and before the actual word “yuan”. In English, this would be like saying “received 700-plus dollars”. You could also say 收到了700多元, which means the same thing.\nAnd finally: Beware the definition I give for the word 由 here. It’s one of those grammar words that means a ton of different things in different contexts – kind of like how the English word “to” is hard to define and used often. In my definition list, I only ever show the definition relevant to this text, so you’re going to see the word 由 in many contexts in many essays and it doesn’t always mean what it means here.\nThe original is from my new favorite Chinese essay composition site.\n",

    "englishText": "\nChildhood seems like a boat that is full of sweet candy, but is also laden with grief. \nI was born into a happy six-person family. There’s father, mother, grandpa, grandma, my elder sister and myself. \n[The story begins] when I was four, on a scorching afternoon. Grandpa, grandma, mother and my elder sister were all busy doing their own thing. Dad picked me up and carried me to the store, and bought me lots of candy. On the way back to the house, dad put me down, and went to our house’s back garden to plant apple trees. I went with him, and asked him ‘what are you doing’? Father said: “I’m planting apple trees, when autumn arrives you’ll have apples to eat.” Father continued: “Whatever seeds you plant will grow.” Father finished speaking and went back into the house to drink tea. Then I thought to myself if I take the candy I just bought and plant it in the earth, in autumn I should have lots of candy! \nI did just that, I dug a hole, took my left over candy and put it all in the hole, using dirt to bury it. In silence I fervently hoped: “Candy, grow quickly! Candy, grow quickly! Grow into a big tree, and sprout lots and lots of candy.” I told this wish to my father, and he listened. Laughing heartily he said: “Candy can’t grow into a big tree, and it definitely can’t sprout more candy.” I heard my father’s words and I sat down on the grass and started sobbing, my candy, my candy. Father quickly ran up to me, embraced me and said: “Oh, don’t cry little darling, daddy will buy you lots and lots of candy.” I listened to him and stopped crying.\nNowadays I’ve already grown up, and I won’t try foolishly planting candy again.\n",

    "summary": "Chinese Title: 童年傻事\nThis essay about a kid who takes his father’s advice a little too literally (with amusing results) is almost as beginner as a five-paragraph read can get. You’ll find very few intermediate-level words, and extremely basic sentence structure.\nOnly thing intermediate about this read is the very first sentence, which we’ll talk about here. After this it’s pretty easy going. The essay starts out 童年仿佛是一条小船，里面装满了甜蜜的糖果，也装满了许多忧伤。 Let’s break this one down word by word:\n童年 – tóng nián – Childhood\n仿佛 – fǎng fú – seems like\n是 – shì – [it] is\n一条 – yī tiáo – a (literally: the word “one” plus the classifier for boats, which is 条)\n小船, – xiǎo chuán – boat,\n里面 – lǐ miàn – inside\n装满了 – zhuāng mǎn le – is full (of)\n甜蜜的 – tián mì de – sweet\n糖果, – táng guǒ – candy,\n也 – yě – also\n装满了 – zhuāng mǎn le – is full (of)\n许多 – xǔ duō – much\n忧伤 – yōu shāng – distress.\nPretty straightforward when you look at it that way. A quick note on that: though the word 糖果 (which appears a lot in this text) means “candy”, it does not mean “candy fruit” or “sweet fruit”, as you might guess from the character 果. This is just a general word for candy, though the Chinese don’t consider chocolate a “candy” – it’s in its own category.\nThe original is from a Chinese essay composition site.\n",

    "englishText": "\nAll his life, Shen Nong had a crystal abdomen, and one could clearly see all of his internal organs. At that time, humans were often getting sick and even dying because they ate things indiscriminately [not knowing if they were good or bad]. Shen Nong determinedly tasted everything everywhere; the good-tasting things he put in a bag on his left side, those were for people to eat; the bad-tasting things he put in a bag on his right side, and those were used for medicine.\nThe first time, Shen Nong tasted a small fresh leaf. As this leaf fell into his stomach, it cleaned every inch of his insides so that every organ top and bottom was fresh and cool, as if [the leaf] was somehow on patrol [making the rounds], so Shen Nong called it “chá” [to investigate / check], and later generations of men called it “chá” [tea]. Shen Nong put it in the bag on the right. The second time, Shen Nong tasted a little light red flower that looked like a butterfly, which was sweet and delicious, with an exotic smell that filled his nostrils, so he called it “licorice”. He put it in the bag on the left. In this way, Shen Nong diligently tasted all manner of flora, and every time he was poisoned, he used tea to rescue himself. Before long, the bag on his left contained 47,000 kinds of flowers, grasses, roots and leaves, and the right side had 398,000 kinds. \nBut one day, Shen Nong tasted “heartbreak grass”, and this poison was too terrible, so there wasn’t enough time to eat the tea leaves to detoxify and he died. He sacrificed himself to save humanity, so people call him the “Bodhisattva of Medicine”, and people forever commemorate him through this story.\n",

    "summary": "Chinese Title: 神农尝百草\nA cool introduction to one of the lesser-known deities, Shen Nong 神农 shén nóng, the God of Agriculture (and later called the Bodhisattva of Medicine). This is upper-intermediate reading: expect a lot of new words (mostly relating to plants and Chinese medicine) but intermediate sentence structure, and sentences mostly communicate a complete point.\nShen Nong, we are to understand, had a transparent abdomen so all his innards could be seen from the outside (yes, the first sentence does say ‘Shen Nong had a crystal belly’), and he always carried two bags with him – read the story to find out what the bags were for.\nWe touch on the origins of some well-known plants (one of which is poorly described, I think), but the last paragraph talks about the herb “heartbreak grass” – 断肠草 duàn cháng cǎo – which I’d never heard of and which is not a common plant. The English botanical name is Gelsemium elegans (yeah, no idea), which according to the abstract of one study is “a toxic plant indigenous to southeastern Asia, well known among hill tribes as an effective means for committing suicide”. So a very potent poison, then.\nOriginal post was found on a cool mythology and fable website – you may find some other interesting stuff there. I made a tiny edit from the original to correct a mistake.\n",

Altogether, it had four floors, each narrower than the one below, so the topmost floor was just a small minaret topped with a glass dome. \nThe gloomy outer wall was already in a state of extreme disrepair, and the dark and the vaulted roof looked as if it had been stabbed full of holes. \nThe windows were all arched, there were far more of them than actually necessary, and they had wooden boards nailed over them. \nThe house had towered atop this isolated hill since 1911. Sometimes, the nearby villagers would find that the building was like a magnet, attracting dark clouds, lightening, hail, wind and rain. \nIf anyone walked near the house during summer, they would discover a strange phenomenon: the few surrounding trees were all bare. The tree branches were like dark arms, pointing tall towards the sky. \nThe land was encircled by a low fence, which had been broken in several places, and the wooden slats were missing. It was in such a state that some parts of it had even been completely buried by weeds.\n",

    "summary": "This excerpt is one of the Tiger Team supernatural mystery novels for adolescents. The Tiger Team series was originally created in German by author Thomas C. Brezina, and features a band of young detectives: Jupiter Katz, son of a supernatural researcher Erasmus Katz, Jupiter’s cousin Vicky and Vicky’s little brother Nick. This is listed as “advanced” not necessarily because of the vocabulary – which isn’t terribly difficult – but also because some of the sentence structures aren’t very straightforward. This is the easy end of the advanced spectrum, so if you think you might be an advanced reader, try this.\nI found this Chinese translation of the Tiger Team novel “Ghost Hotel” in my local bookstore, and I’ve manually typed in the first few paragraphs of the book, which describe a dilapidated, mostly-abandoned hotel, where most of the novel takes place. This is interesting practice in reading longer descriptions, and includes many words that are strictly book-language: you’re not likely to run into them in daily conversation. There’s probably an actual English version of this book, but I can’t easily get my hands on this, so bear in mind you’re not reading the official English translation. Here’s the Chinese version on Amazon China.\nThere are a couple of difficult passages here that don’t quite mean what they seem to mean. One is 木条都不知下落了. Originally, I read this as “wooden slats scattered here and there”, or literally “wooden slats fallen down in who knows how many places”. But thanks to my Chinese friend Anna, I learned that 下落, in this case, doesn’t mean “fall down”. It means “where is it?” (the same as 在哪儿). So 不知下落 actually means “to be missing”, or “to be gone to who knows where”.\nAnother phrase I should note is 数目远远大于实际需要, “an amount (数目) far (远远) greater (大于) than actually (实际) needed (需要)”. 大于 was a new word for me, and I didn’t know that 远远 – meaning “far away” – can also sometimes be used the same way in Chinese as in English, to mean “very” (example: far above the normal amount).\n",

    "englishText": "\nIn Malaysia, women often become the victims of robberies, sexual harassment and other violent acts. According to a November 30 French media report, in order to better protect women from violence, last weekend the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur released 50 “women’s taxis” which will only transport women.  \nThe top of the windshields of these taxis show a sign reading “women’s taxi”, and the drivers are also women. the project is a cooperation between several of Kuala Lumpur’s taxi companies and the project initiator, Malaysia’s Department of Women, Family and Community Development, who said that they hope to increase the number of “women’s taxi’s” to 400.   \nThis has received a warm welcome from the local women. “This act is of course very good, we can feel safer getting into a taxi,” said 26-year-old office worker Na Xi Er (proper name). However, some female taxi drivers worry about the loss of male customers, and some people are concerned that because of what the “women’s only taxis” symbolize, the female drivers will become the target of attacks.\nBefore this, Malaysia has already released pink women-only train carriages, as well as buses that only carry women, in order to [help women] avoid suffering harm from sexual harassment. Besides Malaysia, Mexico, Egypt, Iran and other countries have already unveiled women-only taxis.\n",

I know I keep harping on 称 every time the word comes up in a news post, but I can’t stress strongly enough how often you’ll see this word in the newspaper – it’s in just about every article, and once you know what it means, news reading becomes that much clearer.

        "In Malaysia, women often become the victims of robberies, sexual harassment and other violent acts. According to a November 30 French media report, in order to better protect women from violence, last weekend the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur released 50 “women’s taxis” which will only transport women.  ",
        "The top of the windshields of these taxis show a sign reading “women’s taxi”, and the drivers are also women. the project is a cooperation between several of Kuala Lumpur’s taxi companies and the project initiator, Malaysia’s Department of Women, Family and Community Development, who said that they hope to increase the number of “women’s taxi’s” to 400.   ",
        "This has received a warm welcome from the local women. “This act is of course very good, we can feel safer getting into a taxi,” said 26-year-old office worker Na Xi Er (proper name). However, some female taxi drivers worry about the loss of male customers, and some people are concerned that because of what the “women’s only taxis” symbolize, the female drivers will become the target of attacks.",
        "Before this, Malaysia has already released pink women-only train carriages, as well as buses that only carry women, in order to [help women] avoid suffering harm from sexual harassment. Besides Malaysia, Mexico, Egypt, Iran and other countries have already unveiled women-only taxis."

        "这些车的挡风玻璃顶端标有“女性出租车”字样，司机也是女性。与吉隆坡几家出租公司合作发起该项目的马来西亚妇女、家庭和社会发展部称，希望将“女性出租车”数量增加到400辆左右。",
        "此举受到了当地女性的热烈欢迎。“这项举措当然很好，我们乘车时会感到更加安全。”26岁的办公室文员纳西尔说。不过，有的女司机担心男性乘客会因此流失；也有人担忧“女性出租车”的标志可能会使驾驶这种出租车的女司机成为袭击目标。",
        "马来西亚此前还曾推出粉红色女性专用火车车厢、只载女乘客的女性专用公交车，以免女性受到性骚扰等伤害。除了马来西亚，墨西哥、埃及、伊朗等国都曾推出女性专用出租车。"

The household dog ran over and licked Hao Hao’s shoes. \nHao Hao looked up, and naively said: “Mama, is doggie cold? Why doesn’t it wear shoes?” Mama smoothly said: “Go and ask it.” \nSo Hao Hao looked down, and in the dog’s ear said: “Little doggie, are you cold? Should I give you some shoes to wear?” Suddenly he loudly shouted, “Mama, doggie said he’s cold, it nodded its head at me!”\nNot long after, Hao Hao took off his own shoes, and put them on the dog’s two front feet.\n“Mama, there are still two feet missing!” \n“Which two feet are missing?” \n“Doggie is still missing shoes for two of his feet…”\nBefore he’d finished speaking, the dog barked woof woof woof, and ran away. Hao Hao hung his head, blushing, and he pulled at the corner of his clothes, too embarrassed to go to his mother, and he called out: “The dog ran off wearing the new shoes, the dog and I are now the same, we both have two bare feet!\n",

    "summary": "A short, sweet, very simple read about a boy, his dog, and a new pair of shoes.\nIn this story, the name of the young boy is 浩浩 hào hào, and you’ll see those two characters a lot. You’ll also see in several places that characters are sometimes doubled up. When writing is intended for young children, you’ll often see characters repeated twice. For example, while 小狗 means ‘dog’, 狗狗 might be equivalent to “doggie” – it’s essentially baby-talk.\nThere is one difficult little clause in this text, which is: 扯着衣角. Let’s examine it piece-by-piece. 扯 chě means to pull at something. 着 zhe, in this instance, means “ing”, or “while doing”. So we’ve now got “Pulling at…”. Then there’s 衣 yī, meaning “clothing”, so we now have “Pulling at clothing…”. And finally 角 jiǎo, corner. So the sentence reads “Pulling at clothing corner”, or in better English, “Pulling at the corner of his clothes”.\nThe Chinese title of this story is: 小狗穿鞋\n",

    "englishText": "\nRespected teacher, dear classmates, hello! \nThe topic of my speech today is “Love Our China”.\nThere are two sayings, “My mother and father birthed me, my country raised me.” And “Country, country, you must have a country before you have a home.” I love my motherland, it surpasses everything that I love! \nOn every patriotic work, we see Zhan TianYou, Qian XueSen, and similar patriots, who gave up good pay, gave up good career prospects, to forcefully fight back against the imperialists who looked down on China. They used their actions to say loudly, “Motherland, I love you!” \nIn every patriotic movie, we see heroic soldiers who lost their heads and sprinkled their blood on the battlefields for their motherland to defend our borders, and when the gun smoke cleared, the battlefields were littered with corpses. It’s as if those soldiers who were about to die said, “Motherland, you are forever in my heart!”  \nEvery Chinese Olympic athlete on the TV screen who seizes the championship in a competition is always smiling brilliantly, as sons and daughters of the motherland, they feel matchless pride. When our flag is raised, hot tears roll down their cheeks as they gaze at the five-starred red flag, in their hearts they are shouting: “Motherland, I won this honor for you!” \nWe can’t cast our blood on the battlefield like those warriors, we can’t build the motherland as the great men did… right now we must study well, use our wisdom and knowledge to arm ourselves so that after we grow up we can return with our service the kindness our motherland has done us, we should be like Premier Zhou [Zhou EnLai], read books so that China may rise up! Be an ambitious person.\n",

    "summary": "Welp, you can’t get more forcefully patriotic than this. This transcript of a student’s classroom speech reads like a political call-to-action and includes rousing images of bloody soldiers, strong Chinese athletes and Chinese workers throwing off the yoke of imperialist might. This might be upper intermediate level reading, but I’m classifying it as advanced, as the sentence structure really isn’t very straightforward, and there are quite a few new words.\nThere’s a saying in the third paragraph that makes no sense in English, only in Chinese. The saying is: ‘国家国家，有国才有家’. This translates to “Country, country, have country, then home.” Doesn’t mean much, does it? But we must examine the structure of the sentence to see that this is actually a play on words. The word for “country” is 国家. 国, by itself, means “country” or “kingdom”. 家, by itself, means “home” or “family”. Put them together, and you get the complete, proper word for “country”. So the author is first saying the word “country” twice (国家国家), then the second part means “the word country is made up first of the character for country, THEN then character for ‘home’”, in other words, “you must have a country before you can have a home or family”. This seems to also insinuate that “country should come before family”.\nIf you remember no other word in this whole essay, remember this one: 祖国 zǔ guó. Look at it: 祖国 祖国 祖国 祖国. It means “motherland”, and once you know it, you will see it everywhere.\nAnother interesting word here is 帝国主义者, which means “imperialist”. If you ever have plans to use your Chinese skills to read old Maoist textbooks, you’d better remember that one as well. It also contains a useful grammar point: 主义者 is equivalent to the English suffix “ist”, as in “imperial-ist”. 主义, without 者, is equivalent to the “ism”. So 帝国主义 is “imperialism”. This can be applied to other words, such as 女权主义者 (feminist) and 女权主义 (feminism), and 理想主义者 (idealist) and 理想主义 (idealism).\nThe title of this speech is: 爱我中华\nYou can find the original here\n",

        "In every patriotic movie, we see heroic soldiers who lost their heads and sprinkled their blood on the battlefields for their motherland to defend our borders, and when the gun smoke cleared, the battlefields were littered with corpses. It’s as if those soldiers who were about to die said, “Motherland, you are forever in my heart!”  ",
        "Every Chinese Olympic athlete on the TV screen who seizes the championship in a competition is always smiling brilliantly, as sons and daughters of the motherland, they feel matchless pride. When our flag is raised, hot tears roll down their cheeks as they gaze at the five-starred red flag, in their hearts they are shouting: “Motherland, I won this honor for you!” ",
        "We can’t cast our blood on the battlefield like those warriors, we can’t build the motherland as the great men did… right now we must study well, use our wisdom and knowledge to arm ourselves so that after we grow up we can return with our service the kindness our motherland has done us, we should be like Premier Zhou [Zhou EnLai], read books so that China may rise up!

    "englishText": "\nToday is the Dragon Boat Festival, my family got out of bed at 5:00, and in accordance with local customs, when up the mountain to wade in the dew. On the road, I used both hands to cup sparkling dewdrops and smear them on my eyes, for a moment I felt as if they [my eyes] were considerably brightened. I felt they remained extremely bright as I sat in the classroom and read books; I could see every word clearly. \nWhen school let out, I let my legs loose and ran towards home. As soon as I reached the door I could smell the scent of zongzi, and as I entered I saw my father had made a whole table of delicious food that was just waiting for me to come home and eat it. I washed my hands and went to the dining table, first I broke open one zongzi each for father and mother and sprinkled them with white sugar, then I broke open a beautiful triangular zongzi for myself, sprinkled it with white sugar and heartily began eating.  At the dining table, our family ate and chatted, the woom was full of Dragon Boat Festival good cheer, suffused with the savory smell of zongzi and thick with the smell of wormwood.\nAfter we’d had eaten, mother spread realgar wine on my ears, put lipstick on my lips, placed [bracelets of] red rope around my wrists, and made sure I smelled as sweetly as a zongzi, then sent me off back to school to study. \nI love eating zongzi, I loved the Dragon Boat Festival, and I love enjoying the holiday cheer.\n",

    "summary": "While we’re busy prepping for our holiday season, I figured I’d post something about a Chinese holiday. This is a culturally-rich and comfortably intermediate essay describing how one family celebrates the Dragon Boat Festival (端午节 duān wǔ jié. If you’re curious what the typical Chinese household does on this late-spring holiday (held on the fifth day of the fifth month of the Chinese lunar calendar), you’ll love this read. The customs described are quite unlike any holidays in the West.\nThe dragon boat festival is held in remembrance of poet Qu Yuan’s death. Qu Yuan was a faithful servant of his emperor, but was falsely accused of being a traitor. He drowned himself in a river after several decades in exile, but the local people loved him and remember him fondly. Sounds morbid, but actually the festival is a joyous one, where dragon boats are raced on the river (to commemorate the search for Qu Yuan’s body) and 粽子 zòng zi (boiled triangular rice balls wrapped in leaves) are eaten (when he died, it’s said that 粽子 were thrown into the river to feed him in the afterlife – other stories have it that people threw 粽子 into the river to keep the fish from eating his body before they could find it).\nA couple of words in this essay are not in the dictionary, and need explaining: namely 艾香. I this case, 艾香 ài xiāng means “the smell of wormwood”, and it refers to the smell produced by bouquets of wormwood (艾草) that people hang on their door during the Dragon Boat Festival to drive away bad luck.\nAnother word here is 雄黄酒, something that I’ve seen but never tried, and while there is an English word for this, I’ve never heard this spoken in English. 雄黄酒 is “realgar wine”, whatever the heck realgar is. If you’re curious, this article has more information on realgar wine and it’s association with the Dragon Boat Festival.\nAnd finally, there’s 趟露水, literally “to wade in the dew”, and it refers to (what I think is a) regional custom of going out on an early morning walk and anointing one’s face with dew drops. And without further adew (har!), the Chinese title of this essay is 我家的端午节.\n",

The word “ice skating” appears about a bazillion times in the space of these few sentences, so, after reading this, you may expect to recognize the word for the rest of your natural life.\nA note: The characters 周井寒 which appear in this essay are a person’s name. The person is referred to twice, first by their given name, 井寒, then by their full name, 周井寒. The person’s relationship to the author isn’t really specified. This clearly isn’t the name of the child’s mother, as 周井寒 is referred to as a “he”.\nThe Chinese title of this essay is 快乐的我.\nAnd here’s the original source\n",

    "englishText": "\nJiaozi uses flour to make the wrapping [lit: skin], but the stuffing can be made from myriad things, and modified to suit individual tastes. Because of this, jiaozi is a food enjoyed by people in every region, in every season, both young and old alike. Chinese people love to eat jiaozi, and with the exception of its multitude of flavors, the main reason is that over the course of its several-thousand-year [culinary] development, jiaozi is a food that has come to represent good luck. Jiaozi is oval in shape, and thus it looks very similar to the ancient fake gold ingots that signified wealth. Especially during Chinese New Year, when welcome the new and dismiss the old, families reunite and eat jiaozi, which [if eaten] at the beginning of the year can increase wealth and can bring even better days. Even more importantly, because jiaozi is filled with stuffing, you can fill it with many different types of [food that traditionally has an] auspicious significance. For example, if someone’s getting married, you can stuff the jiaozi with peanuts or chestnuts to mean that you hope the couple will give birth to a son soon. Such little jiaozi carries so much significance, and it’s been linked to China’s social traditions in countless ways. Since ancient times, people have had many customs about eating jiaozi, such as eating it on New Year’s eve, and eating it on PoWu [Broken Five festival]. \n",

Steamed, boiled, or (as is more often the case in Japan) fried, Jiaozi has been around for thousands of years, and is most traditionally eaten on New Years Eve.\nThis short essay from ChinaVegan.com introduces the dish and covers its traditional significance.\nYou’ll notice a reference to 破五 pò wǔ, the fifth day of New Years festivities. During the first four days, tradition dictates that it’s forbidden to cook, clean, or argue, but on the fifth day, these rules may all be broken, hence the name “Broken Five” festival.\n",

In Beijing, Shanghai, WuHan, NanChang, ChengDu, ZhengZhou and XiAn, the railroad office and Guangzhou Railway Group together launched bank card ticket sales at their 256 relatively large railway stations. To meet the needs of Spring Festival travelers, Beijing Station, Beijing West Station, Beijing South Station and other stations will implement 24-hour ticket sales. At Beijing West Station, 24-hour sales will be available in the North Square and South Square ticket offices. During peak sales times, Beijing Station and Beijing South Station will have 419 ticket windows open for business to ensure that sales can continue around the clock.\n",

    "summary": "If you’ve ever been to China during Spring Festival (Chinese New Year), you know how impossible it is to make travel plans or book tickets during that time, as the whole country prepares to make the journey back home to see family and friends. It’s nice if you’re a foreigner living in a major metropolitan area, as whole cities empty out, traffic disappears, and you get a temporary respite from the sounds of construction.\nTrain tickets are particularly impossible to come by, as trains are the cheapest and most popular way return home. This article addresses a couple of ways that the transport authorities plan to address the problem this year.\nIt’s also interesting to note that bank cards (debit / credit cards) have been almost useless in China until the last decade or so, as restaurants, bars, smaller hotels, ticket offices and grocery stores rarely accept them. This, as we can see from this article, is gradually changing.\n",

She recently participated in an examination for an American college. That test is very hard, but she did very well – she earned full marks. I heard that only three people in the whole world got full marks. This college gave Jiang Ping their highest scholarship. We’re all very happy for her.\nNext week she’s going to study abroad in America, and all our classmates are going to see her off.\nJiang Ping’s house is on the east side of the city very far away from mine. I left my house a little after four o’clock in the afternoon, and didn’t get there until 5:30. When I arrived, the rest of our classmates were already there.\nJiang Ping warmly welcomed us. She hadn’t seen her classmates in a while, and after she greeted us, we talked and smiled, chatting happily. We wished Jiang Ping success. Wished her a pleasant trip. I said, Be sure to write often. Jiang Ping said, Of course. When she said “Goodbye”, she cried, and I also cried.\nOn my way home, I thought, We often say “Goodbye” [lit: see you again], but sometimes “Goodbye” is sad.

    "summary": "This short essay, taken from the Beijing Language and Culture University beginner comprehension textbook, is written from the perspective of a friend visiting Jiang Ping （江苹） before she leaves the country. The language is mostly school-centric as the writer discusses his classmates, Jiang Ping’s scholarship, and her test results.\nThe crux of the last paragraph hinges on the fact that the Chinese word for “Goodbye” (再见) literally translates as “See you again”, as the writer wonders when or if he’ll ever really see Jiang Ping again.\n",

She studies very hard, she’s the best student in our class. She studies, she plays, and she also often helps others. The teacher and the other students like her. She recently participated in an examination for an American college. That test is very hard, but she did very well – she earned full marks. I heard that only three people in the whole world got full marks. This college gave Jiang Ping their highest scholarship. We’re all very happy for her.",
        "Next week she’s going to study abroad in America, and all our classmates are going to see her off.",
        "Jiang Ping’s house is on the east side of the city very far away from mine. I left my house a little after four o’clock in the afternoon, and didn’t get there until 5:30. When I arrived, the rest of our classmates were already there.",
        "Jiang Ping warmly welcomed us. She hadn’t seen her classmates in a while, and after she greeted us, we talked and smiled, chatting happily. We wished Jiang Ping success. Wished her a pleasant trip. I said, Be sure to write often. Jiang Ping said, Of course. When she said “Goodbye”, she cried, and I also cried.",

    "englishText": "\nEveryone might think that a single drop of oil is insignificant. A drop on the ground is just a tiny oily smear, and if you put it in a car, the car couldn’t even go a few meters. But we shouldn’t underestimate this little drop of oil. It’s very old, and it’s experienced hundreds of millions of years of evolution, having passed through many thousands of various processes before finally, from the very first animals, becoming the substance we use today in cars, and the petrol and deisel we use in various machines. After this, we’ll take a look at the story of this drop of oil, and we’ll give him a name – how about we call him “You Di”. Because oil truly is the most precious treasure the earth has given us. Our industrial society was built on the foundation of the oil industry. If we didn’t have oil, our machines wouldn’t work, our cars wouldn’t start, and we’d have no way to produce many everyday necessities, even basic things like soap and washing clothes, all these are products of the oil industry.\n",

The ad encourages young adults to check out Sinopec’s Flash-animated history of oil, completed with the requisite cartoon oil-drop mascot named “You Di” (a homophone for “oil drop”). Using typically expansive language, the lead-in introduces the mascot and the theme of the presentation.\nSee the original page\n",

        "Everyone might think that a single drop of oil is insignificant. A drop on the ground is just a tiny oily smear, and if you put it in a car, the car couldn’t even go a few meters. But we shouldn’t underestimate this little drop of oil. It’s very old, and it’s experienced hundreds of millions of years of evolution, having passed through many thousands of various processes before finally, from the very first animals, becoming the substance we use today in cars, and the petrol and deisel we use in various machines. After this, we’ll take a look at the story of this drop of oil, and we’ll give him a name – how about we call him “You Di”. Because oil truly is the most precious treasure the earth has given us. Our industrial society was built on the foundation of the oil industry. If we didn’t have oil, our machines wouldn’t work, our cars wouldn’t start, and we’d have no way to produce many everyday necessities, even basic things like soap and washing clothes, all these are products of the oil industry."

        "一滴油，也许大家觉得微不足道，滴在地上只是一个小小的油印，装在车里，车也走不了几米。但大家不要小看这小小的一滴油，他的年纪可真不小，他可是经历了上亿年的演化，经过数千道各种工序才能从最初的生物变成现在用在汽车和各种机器上的汽油柴油。下面我们来讲讲这一滴油的故事，我们给这一滴油起一个名字，就叫做“油迪”吧。因为石油真的是地球留给我们人类的最最宝贵的财富。我们现在的工业社会，都是建立在石油工业的基础之上的，如果没有了石油，我们的机器无法运转，汽车无法开动，很多日常用品也没有办法生产，就连肥皂和洗衣服这些基本日常用品，都是石油工业的产品。"

    "summary": "Nom! Perfect summer snack. Here’s a CRP first driven by a) hunger and b) the ever-present need for a new post. Not only am I going to translate this recipe, I’m going to try to make it as well (god save you all). We’ll be reading the recipe for (and then making) 炸酱面 zhá jiàng miàn, which is a thick ground pork sauce over fresh noodles topped with sliced cucumber, but as I’m vegetarian, I’ll be leaving the pork out. However, the recipe I’m translating does have pork in it, and this sauce really is good with pork, so feel free to put it in according to the Chinese recipe or leave it out and just use the shitake mushrooms, like I do.\nThe 炸酱面 sauce is extremely salty, and if you do this right, you’ll think your sauce has too much salt in it until you put it on the noodles. The saltiness is heavily cut by the blandness of the noodles and the dish ends up being very savory and strongly flavored, but not overpowering. If you don’t live in China, you will need to go to an Asian grocers for one of these ingredients (the dry yellow paste 干黄酱 made from yellow soybeans) (or you can just get 黄酱 – more on that later).\nThe original recipe in Chinese is here: http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_5ddc957b0102ejb9.html?tj=1 (if you’re really feeling frisky, go read the chef’s intro on how these noodles remind her of the smells of her grandmother’s summertime cooking).\nAnd here is what we’re going to try to make:\n\nNow, a little about Chinese cooking: don’t get hung up on perfect measurements – a little more of this or a little more of that isn’t going to kill anyone, and the Chinese cook very haphazardly. You’ll also notice something very interesting in this (and most recipes). We cook by eye – “cook until the edges turn brown” – the Chinese often cook by nose – “cook until the food smells fragrant”.\nI’m going to translate the recipe first, and below that, I’ll post some pics, some tips on the ingredients, and the cooking process.\n",

    "summary": "If you like spicy food and you like potatoes, and you’ve never had 香辣土豆丝 , you’re missing out. Now when I say “spicy” here, I don’t mean American spicy – this dish comes out of the pan crazy hot depending on the type of peppers you use, so it’s not for the faint of heart. You can, of course, tone down the heat by using less chili oil, and I’ve had it made quite bland before, but if you really want to go authentic, get your spice on.\nDone correctly, the potatoes in this dish are of a texture you may not be used to – they’re just barely barely cooked all the way through, and still retain a slight bit of stiffness – not quite a crunch, but almost.\nThis is one of my favs, but it took a little getting used to.\nIf you ever needed proof that most Chinese cooking is done by eye, without much measuring, this recipe proves it – “almost”, “add to taste”, “approximately” – these words crop up frequently.\nRead the original recipe\n",

    "chineseText": "记得一年多前我做过一道上海本地菜–葱烤鲫鱼，结果有网友指出不应该写葱烤鲫鱼，而应该是葱熇鲫鱼。为此我找了好多资料，包括字典、词典、百科全书，发现网友说得没错，烤和熇是完全不同的两种烹饪方式，做出的菜品和口感自然也完全不同，只是不知道为什么本地饭店的菜单上都是写葱烤鲫鱼的，我想这也可能是约定俗成，反正大家都懂的，习惯成自然了吧？\n今天的葱烤鲫鱼真的是烤的，是将鲫鱼腌制后入烤箱烘烤而成。此葱烤鲫鱼不是彼葱熇鲫鱼，那是两种完全不同的口味。葱熇鲫鱼是浓油赤酱的上海口味，而葱烤鲫鱼更多的是由多种香料组成的复合香味，带有一种浓郁西部风味，也是很香很好吃呢！\n材料: 鲫鱼2条、葱100克、姜4片、小红椒2个、香菜50克。\n调料: 料酒1大勺、香醋1大勺、盐5克、胡椒粉1/2小勺、十三香1/2小勺、孜然粉1/2小勺、花椒粉1/2小勺、香油1大勺。\n鲫鱼去鳞、鳃、肠洗净滤干，在鱼背上用刀划几道后放入盘中，姜片分别放入鱼腹中；\n加料酒、香醋、盐5克、胡椒粉、十三香抹匀腌1小时；\n烤盘铺上锡纸，将香葱摆放在盘底，腌好的鱼控干水分，两面刷油后放在葱上；\n烤箱预热至180度，烤盘放入中层，烤15分钟；\n取出烤盘将鱼翻面，再烤15分钟；\n取出烤盘再在鱼身上刷层油，撒上孜然粉、花椒粉、红椒圈和香菜梗，再入烤箱烤2分钟；\n取出撒上香菜叶即可。\n",
    "englishText": "\nI remember over a year ago I did a local Shangai dish, Onion Roasted Carp, and as a result, one of my internet friends pointed out that I shouldn’t have called it “Onion Roasted Carp”, it was actually “Onion Dried Carp”. Because of this, I checked a bunch of sources, including character dictionaries, word dictionaries and encyclopedias, and found that my online friend was right, “Roasted” and “Dry” [both are pronounced kǎo in Chinese] are two entirely different culinary methods. Naturally, the cooking materials and texture are also completely different, I just don’t know why local restaurant menus all write it “Onion Roasted Carp”; I think it was just established that way from popular usage, as something that everyone understands, and perhaps the habit just became the norm?  \nToday’s Onion Roasted Carp really is roasted. After the carp is marinated, it’s put into the oven and baked before it’s done. This Onion Roasted Carp isn’t that Onion Dried Carp, those are two entirely different flavors. Onion Dried Carp has a Shanghai flavor that’s thick with oil and red sauce, while Onion Roasted Carp has a complex bouquet made from a wider variety of ingredients and elements, and has a dense Western [Chinese] flavor, also very fragrant and delicious!\nIngredients: Two Crucian carp, 100 grams of spring onion, four slices of ginger, two little red peppers, 50 grams of coriander \nSeasonings: A big spoon of cooking wine, 1 big spoon balsamic vinegar, 5 grams of salt, 1/2 small spoon of ground pepper, 1/2 small spoon Thirteen Spice, 1/2 small spoon cumin powder, 1/2 small spoon of Sichuan pepper powder, 1 big spoon sesame oil.\n\nTake off the scales, gills and intestines and clean the carp. On the fishs’ back [side], use a knife to make a few cuts [the cook doesn't mean to cut all the way through the fish, just to make a few slices in the skin], place the fish in a dish, then place a few of the ginger slices in each fishs’ stomach.\nAdd the cooking wine, balsamic vinegar, 5 grams of salt, ground pepper and thirteen spice so that the fish is evenly covered, and let marinate for one hour.\nSpread tin foil on a cooking pan, arrange the onions in the bottom of the pan, allow excess moisture to strain out of the mariated fish, then rub oil on both sides of the fish and place them on top of the onions [in the cooking pan].   \nPre-heat the over to 180 degrees [Celcius], place the cooking pan on the middle rack, and let cook for 15 minutes. \nTake the pan out of the oven, turn the fish over, and put them back in the oven for another 15 minutes. \nTake the pan out of the oven and again spread a layer of oil on the fish, sprinkle with cumin, Sichuan pepper, red pepper slices and coriander stalks, then put it back in the oven to bake for another 2 minutes.  \nTake it out and sprinkle the top with coriander leaves, and that’s it.\n\n",

    "summary": "This is a great recipe for Western Chinese style Crucian Carp, roasted with spring onions, coriander, peppers and other spices.\nI found this recipe on Chinese woman’s cooking blog – the original post has step-by-step pictures, so go have a look if you’d like to try your hand at this recipe.\nWhat I find interesting about this recipe is that it requires the use of an oven, and even more interesting, an oven with space for more than one rack. Until very recently, you couldn’t find a Chinese home with an oven in it for any price, and if you wanted to bake, it usually meant a trip to a German appliance store to buy a mini counter-top oven. These days, I’m seeing more and more real estate ads featuring homes with ovens, so this recipe, in my opinion, is a sign of the times.\nIn step 2 of the recipe, the author instructs us to 控干水分 after the fish has marinated for an hour. Not being much of a cook myself, I had quite a bit of trouble sorting out what 控干水分 meant exactly, being that it’s a culinary technique having something to do with moisture control. Searching the Chinese ‘net turned up the answer: this means to allow excess moisture to strain or seep out of an ingredient. For leafy vegetables, this would mean putting them in a strainer and lightly shaking the water out, or letting it drip out. For meat, this likely means lightly patting it with paper towels to soak up excess moisture, or letting it sit on paper towels to soak the moisture out.\nIf anyone out there’s a chef and knows a better way, by all means, do tell.\n",

    "chineseText": "甜点一道，竹笋的大爱。\n这道甜点不是来自网络的菜谱，而是我们这个周五去星星家吃饭，她的妈妈做了红豆珍珠圆来当甜点。就是用红豆/红枣煮好再加入小小的实心汤圆， 很好吃，我和老公一人吃了一大碗， 回家自己发挥了一下，有了这个甜点。原本只给了竹笋一勺，没想他一声声喊着“还要”，一人居然吃了三小碗，我们担心他吃坏了就不给了，但是儿子这么喜欢吃，做妈的心里还是有点小得意，赶紧整理菜谱，大家一起分享。\n红豆浸泡过夜\n一份红豆，三到四份清水一起用高压锅煮，上汽后改中火压十分钟即可。\n气阀落下后，将红豆舀出，红豆汤依然留在锅中。\n将红豆加少许红豆汤一起用搅拌机搅伴成糊状。\n再将红豆糊倒入红豆汤里，加热，并加糖调到自己喜欢的甜度。 我加的是冰糖。\n加入一碗水淀粉勾芡，使得红豆糊呈现粘粘的奶昔状,关火。\n事先准备好糯米粉加水撮成小的糯米粉圆。\n水烧开，加入糯米粉圆，粉圆浮起就算煮好了。\n在红豆糊里加入小的粉圆，就是成品了。 我不直接用红豆来煮的原因是这么处理后，汤羹很有红豆沙的感觉，配上糯糯的汤圆，非常可口。\n",
    "englishText": "\nZhuSun [author's son] absolutely loves this dessert.\nI didn’t find this recipe on the internet. On Friday, we went to XingXing’s house to eat, and her mom made Red Bean Paste Pearl Soup for dessert. It’s made by boiling red beans or red dates and then adding little soup balls. It’s delicious – my husband and I each ate a large bowl, and after we’d gone home, I made a dinner myself that featured this dessert. We originally just gave ZhuSun one spoonful, I didn’t expect the constant cries of “More please!” He ate three whole bowls by himself, and we worried that he’d make himself sick, so we didn’t give him any more, but making something that her son loves to eat fills a mother’s heart with pride, so I quickly tidied up the recipe to share with everyone.\n\nSoak the red beans overnight.\nTake one part red beans and three to four parts water and boil them together in a pressure cooker. When steam comes out, adjust to medium heat, and let cook for another 10 minutes [lit: 10 minutes should do].\nOnce the pressure valve drops, scoop out the beans, leaving the soup liquid in the pot.\nPut the beans and a dash of the soup liquid into a blender and blend into a paste.\nPour the paste from the blender back into the pot with the soup, add heat, and add sugar to taste. I used rock sugar. [lit: ice sugar - a common form chunky sugar sold in Chinese grocery stories that looks like pieces of rock candy.]\nAdd a bowl of water with the starchy thickening agent in it, and turn off the heat when the soup appears to have the consistency of a milkshake. [Word \"consistency\" doesn't actually appear in the Chinese sentence, but it is implied].\nPrepare the pearls by mixing glutinous rice flour with water and shaping it into balls.\nBring water to a boil and add the glutinous rice balls. They’re done when they float.\nAdd the glutinous rice balls to the red bean paste soup, and you’re done. I don’t add whole boiled red beans to the soup, because it makes the red bean flavor is too strong, but the sticky rice soup balls make it very tasty.\n\n",

    "summary": "I absolutely love red bean (also known as “Azuki bean”) paste. I like it in ice cream, I like in fried dumplings, I like it in boiled dumplings, and I love it in mooncakes. This recipe, taken from Becky Blog, a Chinese food and recipe journal, walks you through the recipe for making red bean paste soup with glutinous rice flour pearls.\nIf you’ve never been to China, you’ve probably never had this dish. The soup is thick and a bit starchy, and flavored with red bean and sugar. The “pearls” are boiled rice balls with a texture something between gummy and sticky, like huge tapioca balls.\nI had a considerable amount of trouble with the phrase “水淀粉勾芡”, but eventually found the answer here, on the Chinese equivalent of Yahoo! answers. Essentially, this is a recipe-specific phrase describing a kind of thickening process similar to adding corn starch to a jelly; the cook sprinkles starch on hot water, simultaneously stirring with the other hand until the starch dissolves into the water. The starchy water is then stirred into the main dish.\nI don’t want to cut into Becky’s ‘net traffic, so I’m not posting her pictures here, text only. In the original post, she snaps photos of each step of the cooking process, so you might want to check out the original post to get a good feel for the dish.\nSee Becky’s original recipe\n",

    "englishText": "\nA 16-year-old girl said to her mother that she had missed 2 menstrual cycles… as soon as her mother heard this, she rushed in extreme haste to the pharmacy to buy a pregnancy test and confirm the issue… sure enough the daughter was pregnant!  Crying and yelling, the mother asked, “Whichever scoundrel did the happy deed, you make him come face me!!” The daughter was forced to pick up the phone… half an hour later, a brand new Ferrari sports car quickly pulled up to the girl’s front door, and who stepped out of the car but an elegant middle-aged gentleman wearing a completely new set of brand-name clothes. The gentleman entered the room and sat down in the living room with the daughter and her parents. “Good afternoon!” the gentleman politely paid his respects, and said, “Your honorable daughter just told me about this serious problem, but because of my own family situation, I’m very sorry to say I can’t take her to wife, but I will bear the responsibility I should bear. This should do: if a girl child is born, I will give her 3 storefronts, 2 houses, 1 seaside villa and a bank account with 2 million American dollars in it. If a boy is born, he will inherit 2 companies plus a bank account worth 2 million American dollars. If it’s twins, each will inherit one company and a 1 million American dollar bank account. But if it’s a miscarriage…”  At that moment, the girl’s father, who had been sitting silently off to one side, suddenly stood up, put both hands firmly on the gentleman’s shoulders and said, “Don’t worry, if that happens [lit: when the time comes] you can come back again!” \n",

    "summary": "Another slightly off-color “they don’t teach you how to say that in the textbook” joke, this one about two parents dealing with an unexpected pregnancy in the family. This is really upper-intermediate, not really super advanced, but there will be quite a few new words here for lower-intermediate readers.\nYou’ll have to forgive me these couple of recent not-really-for-kids jokes – I’m no primary school teacher, and I find that an endless stream of kids’ jokes gets a bit tiresome, and is not as reflective of real spoken language. This is the kind of joke you’d tell with your friends after a couple of glasses of 啤酒, and you have to admit, as scripted jokes go, this one’s pretty funny.\nIt’s a little hard to get rolling on this one, as the first sentence is a little hard to get past unless you know what they’re talking about, so I’ll explain a bit. The joke starts out: “一个16岁的女孩跟她母亲说她已经2个月没来了”, which literally translates into “A 16-year-old girl tells her mother that already two months hadn’t come.” Once you see it in English, and you know the joke’s about pregnancy, it’s pretty easy to decipher the meaning – the girl hasn’t had her period for 2 months and suspects she’s pregnant. Thing is, the medical word for “menstrual cycle” never actually shows up here – we’re seeing instead the colloquial term “月”, or “moon / month”.\nIt’s also worth noting that in this reading, 令媛 is the name of the pregnant daughter – that is not really explained.\n[CORRECTION: Alert reader Katy informs me that I was very wrong - 令媛 is not the name of the daughter but, \"an old-fashioned term of respect to say 'your daughter' which is in keeping with the status of the man as a 绅士 (gentleman)\". Apparently, when you assume, you make an ass out of 令 and 媛. Thanks Katy.]\nAnd one last interesting grammar point here is the phrase “负该负的责任”. To “负责任”, means to shoulder your responsibilities and fulfill your obligations. So this phrase means “fulfill the responsibilities that should be fulfilled”, or “to bear the responsibilities that one should bear”.\nThe Chinese title of this joke is “你可以再来一次”.\n",

        "A 16-year-old girl said to her mother that she had missed 2 menstrual cycles… as soon as her mother heard this, she rushed in extreme haste to the pharmacy to buy a pregnancy test and confirm the issue… sure enough the daughter was pregnant!  Crying and yelling, the mother asked, “Whichever scoundrel did the happy deed, you make him come face me!!” The daughter was forced to pick up the phone… half an hour later, a brand new Ferrari sports car quickly pulled up to the girl’s front door, and who stepped out of the car but an elegant middle-aged gentleman wearing a completely new set of brand-name clothes. The gentleman entered the room and sat down in the living room with the daughter and her parents. “Good afternoon!” the gentleman politely paid his respects, and said, “Your honorable daughter just told me about this serious problem, but because of my own family situation, I’m very sorry to say I can’t take her to wife, but I will bear the responsibility I should bear. This should do: if a girl child is born, I will give her 3 storefronts, 2 houses, 1 seaside villa and a bank account with 2 million American dollars in it. If a boy is born, he will inherit 2 companies plus a bank account worth 2 million American dollars. If it’s twins, each will inherit one company and a 1 million American dollar bank account. But if it’s a miscarriage…”  At that moment, the girl’s father, who had been sitting silently off to one side, suddenly stood up, put both hands firmly on the gentleman’s shoulders and said, “Don’t worry, if that happens [lit: when the time comes] you can come back again!” "

Typically, one says “100分”, meaning that one received “100%” on a test. In this case, the student indicates that he wants the teacher to give him “5分”, which we can take to mean “5 stars” – not actually 5%. The Chinese title of this joke is “父子不和”.\n",

    "chineseText": "话说某位女士一时兴起，买了一只母鹦鹉。没想到带回家里，它说的第一句话就是: “想跟我上床吗？”\n女士一听，心想: 坏了，外人还以为这话是我教的呢，这不把我的淑女形象全给毁了。于是她想尽办法，想交那只鹦鹉说些高雅的东西，可是那只母鹦鹉算是铁了心了，只会说一句话: “想跟我上床吗？”\n　　…… 怎么办呢？在那位女士失去主张的时候，听说神父那儿也养了一只鹦鹉（公的），而且那只鹦鹉，不但不讲粗话，反而是个虔诚的教徒，每天大部分时间里都在祷告。于是那位女士去找神父求助。神父明白她的来意之后，面色微难的说:“这个，很难办呀，其实那只鹦鹉，也并没有刻意的教它什么，它之所以这么虔诚，也可能是长期在此受熏陶的缘故吧。”\n神父见女士很失落，便说道: “这样吧，你把那只鹦鹉带到我这里来，我把它们放在一起。希望经过一段时间，你那只鹦鹉能够被感化。我只能做这些了，有没有效果，就看神的旨意了……”\n女士一听，也只能这样了，不是有句话叫: 近朱者赤吗？试试吧。于是她把鹦鹉带到神父那里。神父依照诺言把两只鹦鹉放在了一起。开始母鹦鹉还有些拘谨，看那只公鹦鹉在笼子的一角，默默的祷告，还真不忍心打扰。可是她还是管不住自己，终于朗声说道:“想跟我上床吗？“\n公鹦鹉听到这话，停止了祷告，转身看了看母鹦鹉，忽然泪如雨下: “感谢上帝，我祷告这么多年的愿望终于实现了……”\n",
    "englishText": "\nThere once was a woman who bought a female parrot. But little did she know, when she brought the parrot home she found it could only say one sentence: “Will you sleep with me?”\nAs soon as the woman heard this, she thought: “Oh no! If anyone else hears the parrot speak they’ll think I taught the parrot to say that, it’ll destroy my reputation as a virtuous woman.” By way of a solution, she thought maybe she could teach the parrot to say something dainty instead, but it seemed the parrot had a heart of iron, it would only say one thing, “Will you sleep with me?”　\nWhat was she to do? Just when she had about given up, she heard of a priest who also owned a parrot (a male one), and moreover his parrot not only didn’t say vulgar things, it was actually a devout disciple; it spent most of its time in prayer. So the women went to see the priest. When the priest understood the woman’s reason for coming, he said a little sadly, “This is a hard problem to solve. In actual fact, I didn’t teach my parrot anything, maybe the reason it’s like that is because it’s spent a long time in this [church] environment.”　　\nThe priest saw the woman’s disappointment, so he said, “How about this: bring your parrot here to me, I’ll put it with my own. We can hope that after a little while, your parrot will be correctively influenced by mine. This is all I can do, whether it will work or not is up to God…”　\nThe woman listened [to his suggestions], and [also thought] that this was her only option, after all, isn’t there a saying: “Proximity to red will turn you red”? She figured she might as well try it. So the woman brought her parrot to the priest. The priest honored his promise and put the two birds together. At first, the female parrot was a little cautious, seeing the male bird over in one corner of the cage, silently praying, she didn’t have the heart to disturb him. But [after a while] she couldn’t help herself, and finaly said, “Will you sleep with me?”\nThe male parrot heard her say this, stopped praying, turned around and looked at her, and suddenly with tears streaming down its face said, “Thank you God, the thing I’ve prayed for all of these long years has finally happened…” \n",

    "summary": "This not-too-dirty-but-not-really-clean joke comes from a great blog on the Sina blog network, the Chinese equivalent of Blogger.\nThe joke is about a woman whose new parrot can’t seem to stop saying one particular come hither phrase. The phrase so embarasses the woman that she tries to take action, but her plan doesn’t quite work out the way she wanted.\nI had a bit of trouble translating the phrase 近朱者赤, which appears to mean “If you stand next to something red, you’ll become red yourself.” This idiom isn’t in the dictionary, but I believe it means that people are influenced by the things in their environment.\n",

        "There once was a woman who bought a female parrot. But little did she know, when she brought the parrot home she found it could only say one sentence: “Will you sleep with me?”",
        "As soon as the woman heard this, she thought: “Oh no! If anyone else hears the parrot speak they’ll think I taught the parrot to say that, it’ll destroy my reputation as a virtuous woman.” By way of a solution, she thought maybe she could teach the parrot to say something dainty instead, but it seemed the parrot had a heart of iron, it would only say one thing, “Will you sleep with me?”　",
        "What was she to do? Just when she had about given up, she heard of a priest who also owned a parrot (a male one), and moreover his parrot not only didn’t say vulgar things, it was actually a devout disciple; it spent most of its time in prayer. So the women went to see the priest. When the priest understood the woman’s reason for coming, he said a little sadly, “This is a hard problem to solve. In actual fact, I didn’t teach my parrot anything, maybe the reason it’s like that is because it’s spent a long time in this [church] environment.”　　",
        "The priest saw the woman’s disappointment, so he said, “How about this: bring your parrot here to me, I’ll put it with my own. We can hope that after a little while, your parrot will be correctively influenced by mine. This is all I can do, whether it will work or not is up to God…”　",
        "The woman listened [to his suggestions], and [also thought] that this was her only option, after all, isn’t there a saying: “Proximity to red will turn you red”? She figured she might as well try it. So the woman brought her parrot to the priest. The priest honored his promise and put the two birds together. At first, the female parrot was a little cautious, seeing the male bird over in one corner of the cage, silently praying, she didn’t have the heart to disturb him. But [after a while] she couldn’t help herself, and finaly said, “Will you sleep with me?”",
        "The male parrot heard her say this, stopped praying, turned around and looked at her, and suddenly with tears streaming down its face said, “Thank you God, the thing I’ve prayed for all of these long years has finally happened…” "

        "话说某位女士一时兴起，买了一只母鹦鹉。没想到带回家里，它说的第一句话就是: “想跟我上床吗？”",
        "女士一听，心想: 坏了，外人还以为这话是我教的呢，这不把我的淑女形象全给毁了。于是她想尽办法，想交那只鹦鹉说些高雅的东西，可是那只母鹦鹉算是铁了心了，只会说一句话: “想跟我上床吗？”",
        "　　…… 怎么办呢？在那位女士失去主张的时候，听说神父那儿也养了一只鹦鹉（公的），而且那只鹦鹉，不但不讲粗话，反而是个虔诚的教徒，每天大部分时间里都在祷告。于是那位女士去找神父求助。神父明白她的来意之后，面色微难的说:“这个，很难办呀，其实那只鹦鹉，也并没有刻意的教它什么，它之所以这么虔诚，也可能是长期在此受熏陶的缘故吧。”",
        "神父见女士很失落，便说道: “这样吧，你把那只鹦鹉带到我这里来，我把它们放在一起。希望经过一段时间，你那只鹦鹉能够被感化。我只能做这些了，有没有效果，就看神的旨意了……”",
        "女士一听，也只能这样了，不是有句话叫: 近朱者赤吗？试试吧。于是她把鹦鹉带到神父那里。神父依照诺言把两只鹦鹉放在了一起。开始母鹦鹉还有些拘谨，看那只公鹦鹉在笼子的一角，默默的祷告，还真不忍心打扰。可是她还是管不住自己，终于朗声说道:“想跟我上床吗？“",
        "公鹦鹉听到这话，停止了祷告，转身看了看母鹦鹉，忽然泪如雨下: “感谢上帝，我祷告这么多年的愿望终于实现了……”"

    "summary": "This melancholy kid doesn’t seem to have very much luck with pets or siblings.\nYou may or may not have a little difficulty with the sentence 楼区不让养, which is said in regards to a pet dog. Looking at each word…\n楼 – lóu Building\n区 – qū District / region / area\n不 – bù No, not, doesn’t\n让 – ràng Allow, let\n养 – yǎng Raise, take care of (as in a child or a pet)\n… the meaning isn’t too hard to decipher “the building doesn’t allow raising [of dogs]“. But while the meaning isn’t difficult, some of the words are used a little bit differently than they are in English. For example, in English, when we say someone “raises dogs”, or “raises” any type of animal, it usually indicates some kind of professional or large-scale dedication to breeding that type of animal. When people casually keep a pet or pets, we say they “have a dog”, or “own a dog”. Not so in Chinese. The correct Chinese term for having a pet dog (or many types of pet) is “raising a dog” – 养狗. So, for example, saying “I want to raise a dog” (我想养一只狗) is the equivalent of saying “I want a dog” in English.\nThe other question this raises is “what do they mean by 楼区, ‘building district’”? You’d assume this means the area around your apartment building, and you’d be right – but why “区”? This is because in China, many older apartment blocks are much more like tiny districts or communities than they are in the western world. In one complex, there may be several buildings that make up your block, with little numbered sub-staircases (单元) that each contain 12 or so apartments, and they may include small playgrounds inside the block or have other amenities. 楼区 refers to all buildings in the apartment block, any outdoor areas or amenities for that apartment area.\nThe Chinese title of this text is 我孤独.\n",

    "summary": "This very indignant kid seems destined to be a vegetarian.\nI’d say the most difficult phrase in this little passage is: 家里人都吃得很香. The beginning of that sentence is no problem: 家里人都 “Everyone in the family…”, but 吃得很香 is a bit more difficult, as we don’t have sentence structure similar to this in English. Let’s break it down:\n吃 – chī – To eat\n得 – de – Grammar word, which kind of acts as a bridge between “吃” and “香”, indicating that the result of 吃 (eating) is that it was very 香 (savory)\n很 – hěn – Very\n香 – xiāng – Savory\nAnother interesting thing about this sentence is the word 香, which can mean both “fragrant” (smells good) and / or “savory” (tastes good). I find it particularly interesting that the Chinese recognize in language the interconnectedness of good taste and smell.\nOne other notable point is the word 又, which means “again”. But did you know that in Chinese, there are two ways to say “again”? There’s 又, and there’s also 再. It’s a little alien to a native English speaker that there might be two different ways to say “again”, so let me explain the difference:\n又 – Indicates that the action has already been repeated in the past. Example: “You forgot your homework again? You’re going to get in trouble.” The person being scolded forgot their homework once, then already forgot it again (maybe many times). The forgetting of homework again has already happened. So we use 又.\n再 – Indicates that something will happen again in the future. An example of this would be: Don’t forget your homework again or you’ll get in trouble. In other words, you forgot your homework at least once already, don’t repeat that action again in the future. Another example of this is would be a sentence like, “When will I see you again?” The seeing again hasn’t yet happened – it may happen in the future. So we would use 再.\nThe Chinese title of this text is 爸爸是个大坏蛋.\n",

    "englishText": "\nDuring the Qin dynasty, there was a kind and beautify woman, called Meng JiangNv. One day, she was in her garden doing housework, when she suddenly realized that someone was hiding in the grape arbor. She was hugely startled, and was about to call out, when she saw the person repeatedly wave his hands, and begged her, “Don’t call out, don’t call out, save me! I am Fan XiLiang, and I’m running away from trouble.” Well, during this time, [Emperor] Qin Shi Huang, in order to build the great wall, was seizing people from everywhere to [force them to] do labor, and he’d already worked and starved countless people to death! Meng JiangNv rescued Fan XiLiang, and when she saw that he was well educated and sensible, and good looking with delicate features as well, she began to love him, and Fan XiLiang also liked Meng JiangNv. Their two hearts beat as one, and after seeking the approval of their parents, prepared to become husband and wife. \nOn the wedding day, the Meng house was lit with lanterns and colored banners, and was jam-packed with guests – it was a joyous scene. When it was almost dark out, and those that had come to drink the marriage wine slowly scattered, the bride and groom prepared to enter the marriage chamber, suddenly came the sounds of birds crying and dogs barking, and soon after a company of fierce officers and soldiers charged in, and without listening to any explanation, locked up Fan XiLiang in iron chains and hauled him off to the Great Wall to work. The lovely wedding had come to nothing, and Meng JiangNv felt both grief and indignation, and she longed for her husband day and night. She thought: Instead of sitting here worrying hopelessly, it’s better if I go to the Great Wall and search for him. Yes! That’s what I’ll do! So Meng JiangNv immediately prepared her traveling clothes and set out on the road. \nOn the road, though she couldn’t count how many times she endured wind, frost, rain and snow, trudged across dangerous mountains and treacherous rapids, Meng JiangNv never spoke one word of complaint, never spilled one tear, and finally, drawing strength from her tenacious willpower, and drawing strength from her deep love for her husband, she reached the Great Wall. The Great Wall at this time was made up of many small construction sites that had been strung together to form a long city wall, and Meng JiangNv went from each construction site to the next, but she never saw a trace of her husband. Finally, she drummed up her courage, and asked a group of workers who were just about to begin work: “Do any of you know a Fan XiLiang?” The workers said, “Yes, there was a man like that, he’d just arrived.” When Meng JiangNv heard that, she was indescribably happy! She immediately asked, “Where is he?” The worker said, “He’s dead, his corpse has already been tossed into the wall.”  \nWhen Meng JiangNv heard this grievous news, it was like a clap of thunder from a clear sky, Meng’s eyes went dark, and [she felt] a burst of sadness, and began to sob. She cried for a full three days and three nights, she cried until the sky was twilight and the earth was dark, [until] even Heaven and Earth were moved. The sky became more and more gloomy, the wind more and more fierce, and then there was a great “crash”, and a section of the Wall had been cried down, and Fan XiLiang’s corpse was revealed; Meng JiangNv’s tears dripped on his badly mutilated face. She finally was able to see the husband she loved, but he wasn’t able to see her, because he had already been killed by the cruel Qin ShiHuang.\n",

    "summary": "Seeing as how I just got back from a trip to the Wall myself, I figured I’d stay on that theme. This traditional and very famous story, called 孟姜女哭长城 mèng jiāng nǚ kū cháng chéng, is set in the Qin Dynasty, and is super sad in the way that only East Asian stories can be sad (are we noticing a trend, here?). If you’re the “watches a lot of anime” type, you’ll easily find the beauty here (which lies in the power of tears – where else?), but if you like your fairy-tale endings, prepare for a big downer.\nI happen to enjoy sad stories as long as there’s some sweetness in them, and this one is paced very nicely, so I’m translating it for you here, though it’s much longer than my usual fare (I seem to be trending towards longer stuff these days).\nThis story happens between 259 B.C. and 210 B.C., and describes two characters, our heroine 孟姜女mèng jiāng nǚ, and her love, 范喜良 fàn xǐ liáng, who live under the rule of emperor 秦始皇 qín shǐ huáng during the building of the Great Wall. The story describes how they meet and how they finally part, and dwells on the strength of 孟姜女’s love for her man. There are a few specialized words here pertaining to weddings. One is 喜酒 xǐ jiǔ, meaning “happiness wine”, which is alcohol drunk at weddings to wish the bride and groom well. Another is 洞房 dòng fáng, or “marriage chamber” (literally “cave room”). And yet another is 成亲, meaning “to get married”.\nAn interesting word here is 眼看 yǎn kàn, which means “in a moment”, or “when ____ is just about to happen”, not “the eye sees” or “to look”, as may be supposed.\nOne difficult few words to puzzle out here is in the second paragraph, when it’s stated that some soldiers “不容分说” bù róng fēn shuō charge into the room. 不容 here means “without tolerating” or “would not tolerate”, and 分说 means “to explain”. So we can imagine that this means the soldiers barged in and though people tried to explain the situation to them, they weren’t interested in listening.\n",

        "During the Qin dynasty, there was a kind and beautify woman, called Meng JiangNv. One day, she was in her garden doing housework, when she suddenly realized that someone was hiding in the grape arbor. She was hugely startled, and was about to call out, when she saw the person repeatedly wave his hands, and begged her, “Don’t call out, don’t call out, save me! I am Fan XiLiang, and I’m running away from trouble.” Well, during this time, [Emperor] Qin Shi Huang, in order to build the great wall, was seizing people from everywhere to [force them to] do labor, and he’d already worked and starved countless people to death! Meng JiangNv rescued Fan XiLiang, and when she saw that he was well educated and sensible, and good looking with delicate features as well, she began to love him, and Fan XiLiang also liked Meng JiangNv. Their two hearts beat as one, and after seeking the approval of their parents, prepared to become husband and wife. ",
        "On the wedding day, the Meng house was lit with lanterns and colored banners, and was jam-packed with guests – it was a joyous scene. When it was almost dark out, and those that had come to drink the marriage wine slowly scattered, the bride and groom prepared to enter the marriage chamber, suddenly came the sounds of birds crying and dogs barking, and soon after a company of fierce officers and soldiers charged in, and without listening to any explanation, locked up Fan XiLiang in iron chains and hauled him off to the Great Wall to work. The lovely wedding had come to nothing, and Meng JiangNv felt both grief and indignation, and she longed for her husband day and night. She thought: Instead of sitting here worrying hopelessly, it’s better if I go to the Great Wall and search for him. Yes! That’s what I’ll do! So Meng JiangNv immediately prepared her traveling clothes and set out on the road. ",
        "On the road, though she couldn’t count how many times she endured wind, frost, rain and snow, trudged across dangerous mountains and treacherous rapids, Meng JiangNv never spoke one word of complaint, never spilled one tear, and finally, drawing strength from her tenacious willpower, and drawing strength from her deep love for her husband, she reached the Great Wall. The Great Wall at this time was made up of many small construction sites that had been strung together to form a long city wall, and Meng JiangNv went from each construction site to the next, but she never saw a trace of her husband. Finally, she drummed up her courage, and asked a group of workers who were just about to begin work: “Do any of you know a Fan XiLiang?” The workers said, “Yes, there was a man like that, he’d just arrived.” When Meng JiangNv heard that, she was indescribably happy! She immediately asked, “Where is he?” The worker said, “He’s dead, his corpse has already been tossed into the wall.”  ",
        "When Meng JiangNv heard this grievous news, it was like a clap of thunder from a clear sky, Meng’s eyes went dark, and [she felt] a burst of sadness, and began to sob. She cried for a full three days and three nights, she cried until the sky was twilight and the earth was dark, [until] even Heaven and Earth were moved. The sky became more and more gloomy, the wind more and more fierce, and then there was a great “crash”, and a section of the Wall had been cried down, and Fan XiLiang’s corpse was revealed; Meng JiangNv’s tears dripped on his badly mutilated face. She finally was able to see the husband she loved, but he wasn’t able to see her, because he had already been killed by the cruel Qin ShiHuang."

        "秦朝时候，有个善良美丽的女子，名叫孟姜女。一天，她正在自家的院子里做家务，突然发现葡萄架下藏了一个人，吓了她一大跳，正要叫喊，只见那个人连连摆手，恳求道：“别喊别喊，救救我吧！我叫范喜良，是来逃难的。”原来这时秦始皇为了造长城，正到处抓人做劳工，已经饿死、累死了不知多少人！孟姜女把范喜良救了下来，见他知书达理，眉清目秀，对他产生了爱慕之情，而范喜良也喜欢上了孟姜女。他俩儿心心相印，征得了父母的同意后，就准备结为夫妻。",
        "成亲那天，孟家张灯结彩，宾客满堂，一派喜气洋洋的情景。眼看天快黑了，喝喜酒的人也都渐渐散了，新郎新娘正要入洞房，忽然只听见鸡飞狗叫，随后闯进来一队恶狠狠的官兵，不容分说，用铁链一锁，硬把范喜良抓到长城去做工了。好端端的喜事变成了一场空，孟姜女悲愤交加，日夜思念着丈夫。她想：我与其坐在家里干着急，还不如自己到长城去找他。对！就这么办！孟姜女立刻收拾收拾行装，上路了。",
        "一路上，也不知经历了多少风霜雨雪，跋涉过多少险山恶水，孟姜女没有喊过一声苦，没有掉过一滴泪，终于，凭着顽强的毅力，凭着对丈夫深深的爱，她到达了长城。这时的长城已经是由一个个工地组成的一道很长很长的城墙了，孟姜女一个工地一个工地地找过来，却始终不见丈夫的踪影。最后，她鼓起勇气，向一队正要上工的民工询问：“你们这儿有个范喜良吗？”民工说：“有这么个人，新来的。”孟姜女一听，甭提多开心了！她连忙再问：“他在哪儿呢？”民工说：“已经死了，尸首都已经填了城脚了！”",
        "猛地听到这个噩耗，真好似晴天霹雳一般，孟姜女只觉眼前一黑，一阵心酸，大哭起来。整整哭了三天三夜，哭得天昏地暗，连天地都感动了。天越来越阴沉，风越来越猛烈，只听“哗啦”一声，一段长城被哭倒了，露出来的正是范喜良的尸首，孟姜女的眼泪滴在了他血肉模糊的脸上。她终于见到了自己心爱的丈夫，但他却再也看不到她了，因为他已经被残暴的秦始皇害死了。"

It’s good for beginner readers in the sense that a) it’s short, and b) it’s extremely repetitive – if you can puzzle out the first two or three sentences, the rest should be clear. To get you going, it might be worth noting there that the protagonist is a small blade of (or lump of, or field of – it’s never really defined) grass named “YinYin” (小草银银), who keeps asking one particular favor of each season.\nThe seasons are personified as ladies – for example, “The Lady of Spring” (春姑娘) and “the Lady of Summer” (夏姑娘), etc.\nThere’s so much metaphor going on in this I’m not sure where to start. You could choose to interpret this as a statement about aging, about changing seasons, go nuts.\nAnd on a personal note, not 100% sure I’m happy with the conclusion that’s drawn here, considering I dye my hair all the time, but what the hell.\n",

    "chineseText": "一名剑客去拜访一位武林泰斗，请教他是如何练就非凡武艺的。武林泰斗拿出一把只有一尺长的剑，说:“多亏了它，才让我有了今天的成就。”\n剑客大为不解，问:“别人的剑都是三尺三寸长的，而你的剑为什么只有一尺长呢?兵器谱上说:剑短一分，险增三分。拿着这么短的剑无疑是处于一种劣势，你怎么还说这剑好呢?”\n武林泰斗说:“就因为在兵器上我处于劣势，所以我才会时时刻刻想到，如果与别人对阵，我会是多么的危险，所以我只有勤练剑招，以剑招之长补兵器之短，这样一来，我的剑招不断进步，劣势就转化为优势了。”\n的确，优势和劣势有时候并不是绝对的。把自己放在劣势，就是给自己压力，为自己注入进取的动力，敢于把自己放在劣势的人，最终就有可能把劣势转化成为优势，从而取得胜利。\n",
    "englishText": "\nA swordsman went to pay a visit to a martial arts master [literally: a leading figure in martial arts circles] to ask for guidance on how to train [so as to attain] exceptional martial skill. The martial arts master took out a sword that was only 1 foot long, and said: “Thanks to this, I’ve accomplished what I have today.” \nBewildered, the swordsman asked, “Other people’s swords are all 3 feet 3 inches long, so why is yours only one foot long? The weapons chart says that: if your sword is one-fold shorter, the danger to you is threefold greater. Using this short of a sword undoubtedly places you at a disadvantage, how can you say this is a good sword?” \nThe martial arts master said: “That’s precisely it – my weapon puts me at a disadvantage, so I must always be thinking that if I’m up against another person in a fight, the danger to me is greater, and all I have is my diligently practiced sword maneuvers, so the “length” of my maneuvers must make up for the shortness of my sword; thus, I’m always improving, and a disadvantage is transformed into an advantage.    \nIndeed, “advantage” and “disadvantage” really isn’t always set in stone. If you put yourself at a disadvantage, you put pressure on yourself, pouring into yourself the power to forge ahead; those who dare to place themselves in an inferior position, can perhaps in the end turn their disadvantage into an advantage, and thereby achieve victory.\n",

    "summary": "In this essay you’ll learn to read Chinese martial arts words – well, a few, anyway – but it’s not really the vocabulary that places this in the “advanced” category. It’s more that most of the text is full of wax-on, wax-off Karate Kid statements, as the martial arts master talks about how putting oneself in a position of inferiority allows you to attain superiority.\nThis kind of “making logic out of illogical-sounding contradictions” is very typical of martial arts and Eastern mysticism, and most of this type of stuff comes strait out of Taoist philosophy.\nThere are two phrases I found grammatically difficult to get past, the first being 处于劣势, or as the text has it, 处于一种劣势. “处于” chǔ yú means to “be in a state of…”, or “to be in a position of…”. 劣势 liè shì means “inferior”. Put together, this translates into English as “to be at a disadvantage”, or in the case of 处于一种劣势, “to be at some kind of disadvantage”.\nThe second and more difficult phrase is found in the third paragraph: 以剑招之长补兵器之短. The thing that makes this sentence difficult is all the accursed nebulous words that have many meanings – we’ve got 以, 之, and 补 all smooshed together, and these words are the keys to unlocking the meaning of this sentence. So let’s break this down word by word and see if all the definitions together don’t give us a clue:\n以 – yǐ – The definition of 以 that’s being used here is “by means of” or “by way of”\n剑招 – jiàn zhāo – Swordsmanship maneuvers\n之 – zhī – of\n长 – cháng – length\n补 – bǔ – “to make up for”\n兵器 – bīng qì – Weapon\n之 – zhī – of\n短 – duǎn – shortness\nAh hah! Though this is still a little convoluted, once we know the meaning of 以 and 补 in this instance, this now becomes much simpler to read. It says: “By means of the ‘length’ of [my] swordsmanship maneuvers, [I] make up for the shortness of [my] weapon.” We can see here that “length” doesn’t really mean how “long” something is – “length” here means a high level of skill. The word “length” is just being used to juxtapose against the word “short”.\nYou’ll enjoy this if you’re an upper-intermediate or advanced reader, and are interested in some specialized vocabulary.\nSee the original\n",

I think, because [I've been spending so much time with] your little sister, I haven’t been paying as much attention to you during this time.” As I listened, I hung my head in embarrassment. \nWhen I saw the self-blame on mama’s face, I was very sad, and I said to mama: “Mama, don’t blame yourself, is isn’t your fault at all, it’s that I haven’t worked hard enough, so please don’t be angry, starting now, I’ll earnestly finish all the homework teacher gave me, and I’ll fight to get good grades.

    "summary": "And now a break from all the intermediate and advanced exercises I’ve been posting lately. This one is a straightforward beginner Chinese diary-style essay about a student whose mother is displeased with his (or her, it’s never clarified) homework.\nThere’s only one thing that particularly stands out to me as confusing here, which is when the mother says: 可能是有了小妹妹，我这段时间对你关心少了。 Literally, this translates as “Maybe it’s have small sister, I during this time towards you care little.” The last clause we can translate into less literal and more readable English as “I haven’t looked after you much during this time,” but the first bit, “have small sister” (有了), is confusing. Why “have” 有了?\nIn this case, that could be translated as, “Maybe it’s because we have your little sister,” or “It’s because I had your little sister [to look after]“, though “because” is never actually used in the sentence, it becomes that much harder to read.\n",

    "englishText": "\nLong ago, among the Uighur people there were two lazybones, one called Hashandaiwulaike, the other called Shawutikabake. They were both extremely lazy, depending on their parents for food and clothing, unwilling to do even a little work, from morning to night they sat at the base of a wall and sunned themselves. As time passed this way, their parents [began to] loathe them, and had no choice but to kick them out. The two of them lived a drifter’s life, and went hungry for days at a time, with not even a piece of bread to eat.   \nOne day, they were squatting next to a bread pit discussing what to do. Hashandaiwulaike said: “The best thing would be to go to a place where there’s food and clothes, but you don’t have to work – I don’t know if there is such a place?”\nShawutikabake said: “There’s no such place on this earth, only in heaven! I heard that the immortals in heaven are the happiest.” \nHashandaiwulaike said: “In that case, we should go to heaven. Why on earth would we stay in this place where we have to work and suffer other people’s disdain?” \nShawutikabake said:  “That’s all very well and good, but how will we get up there? Can we find a ladder that long?” \nHashandaiwulaike said: “We could never find a ladder that long, but you can still get up there without a ladder.” \nShawutikabake said: “How?”\nHashandaiwulaike said: “In the valley there’s a Roc bird, when I was little I saw it when I went up there with my father. All we have to do is grab onto the Roc, and he will take us up to heaven.”\nShawutikabake said:  “That’s a great idea, we’ll do it that way.” \nSo the two friends decided thus. On the morning of the next day, they got us and walked to the mountain. When they got to the mountain valley, they found the Roc’s nest, and they hid themselves next to it. They waited until the sun fell behind the mountain and the Roc flew back and had just landed in its nest, when Hashandaiwulaike grabbed it and held it tightly. He promptly called to Shawutikabake to grab his feet, and the Roc was frightened and flew into the sky.\nSo Shawutikabake  was holding on to Hashandaiwulaike’s feet, and Hashandaiwulaike  was holding on to the Roc’s claws, and they floated towards the seventh level of clouds [heaven]. \nShawutikabake asked,” Hey! Are we there yet? I can’t hold on much longer!” \nHashandaiwulaike looked into a gap between the clouds and said, “Almost! I can already see the opening!” \nShawutikabake asked, “How big is the opening? Can we fit into it?” \nHashandaiwulaike answered, “It’s this big.”   As Hashandaiwulaike answered, he used his hands to demonstrate how big the opening [to heaven] was. \nBut to his surprise, as soon as Hashandaiwulaike let go, the two lazy friends parted ways with the Roc, tumbled down, and were smashed into mincemeat.\n",

    "summary": "This is probably the longest text I’ve ever posted, but this is upper-beginner to mid-intermediate reading. I could probably toss this in the beginner category, but the length is prohibitive. The first few sentences are much more intermediate as we learn new vocabulary words and set up the story, but after that the reading is mostly a dialogue which is very smooth and fairly simple, so press through the first paragraph or two if you can.\nI kind of can’t tell weather I should be offended by this or not – the protagonists are two “lazy Uighurs” (A Uighur 维吾尔族 wéi wú ěr zú is a member of the ethnic minority hailing from the Uighur Autonomous Region of China, a politically touchy topic on the mainland). I’ve never seen a folk story about heroic Uighurs or smart Uighurs, or really ever seen a story about Uighurs at all. So to run across this one first makes me wonder if the “lazy Uighur” thing is a mean stereotype or if I just haven’t read widely enough. I’ll have to go in search of some Uighur folk tales in Mandarin and see what I can dig up.\nI really know almost nothing about Uighur cultural history, but this story taught me something interesting: it looks like Uighurs have six-character names (as opposed to two and three character names for Chinese and 4 character names for Japanese). Our two protagonists here are rather lengthily called 哈山代吾来克 Hā shān dài wú lái kè and 沙吾提卡巴克 shā wú tí kǎ bā kè.\nAnother interesting thing: this story mentions a 大鹏鸟 da pěng niǎo – called a “Roc” in English (though I’d never heard that word before). Apparently, it’s a legendary fictional bird of prey, like a giant eagle.\nThe Chinese title of this post is 两个懒汉 – the two lazybones.\n",

        "Long ago, among the Uighur people there were two lazybones, one called Hashandaiwulaike, the other called Shawutikabake. They were both extremely lazy, depending on their parents for food and clothing, unwilling to do even a little work, from morning to night they sat at the base of a wall and sunned themselves. As time passed this way, their parents [began to] loathe them, and had no choice but to kick them out. The two of them lived a drifter’s life, and went hungry for days at a time, with not even a piece of bread to eat.   ",
        "One day, they were squatting next to a bread pit discussing what to do. Hashandaiwulaike said: “The best thing would be to go to a place where there’s food and clothes, but you don’t have to work – I don’t know if there is such a place?”",
        "Shawutikabake said: “There’s no such place on this earth, only in heaven! I heard that the immortals in heaven are the happiest.” ",
        "Hashandaiwulaike said: “In that case, we should go to heaven. Why on earth would we stay in this place where we have to work and suffer other people’s disdain?” ",
        "Shawutikabake said:  “That’s all very well and good, but how will we get up there? Can we find a ladder that long?” ",
        "Hashandaiwulaike said: “We could never find a ladder that long, but you can still get up there without a ladder.” ",
        "Shawutikabake said: “How?”",
        "Hashandaiwulaike said: “In the valley there’s a Roc bird, when I was little I saw it when I went up there with my father. All we have to do is grab onto the Roc, and he will take us up to heaven.”",
        "Shawutikabake said:  “That’s a great idea, we’ll do it that way.” ",
        "So the two friends decided thus. On the morning of the next day, they got us and walked to the mountain. When they got to the mountain valley, they found the Roc’s nest, and they hid themselves next to it. They waited until the sun fell behind the mountain and the Roc flew back and had just landed in its nest, when Hashandaiwulaike grabbed it and held it tightly. He promptly called to Shawutikabake to grab his feet, and the Roc was frightened and flew into the sky.",
        "So Shawutikabake  was holding on to Hashandaiwulaike’s feet, and Hashandaiwulaike  was holding on to the Roc’s claws, and they floated towards the seventh level of clouds [heaven]. ",
        "Shawutikabake asked,” Hey! Are we there yet? I can’t hold on much longer!” ",
        "Hashandaiwulaike looked into a gap between the clouds and said, “Almost! I can already see the opening!” ",

This quick and partial introduction to the mid-90s TV series starring Clare Danes, and is packed full of all kind of great teenage angsty vocabulary you might need if you’re desperate to describe your high school years but don’t know the word for, say, “social idiot”.\nThis piece was probably extracted from somewhere else, because it doesn’t really start or end, it just kind of… is. It seems like the middle of an essay or review about My So-Called Life, so if you’ve never seen the show you might have a harder time with this than if you haven’t.\nGrammatically speaking, this is noteworthy in the sense that even though every sentence starts with a question phrase, no questions are really being asked (and no question marks are used). These sentences should be read in a rhetorical way, similar to the way we’d say, “Isn’t it just the best day?”\nThe Chinese title of “My So-Called Life” is 《生活没有》 (I have no life).\n",

    "summary": "A short first-person essay about a kid lighting firecrackers with his parents. I went back and forth on whether to classify this as “beginner” or “intermediate”. It’s easier than most of my intermediate stuff, but it’s got a tighter density of higher-level words than my beginner stuff. But it’s only a few sentences long. I finally settled on “Intermediate”, but if you’re beginner level and you’re willing to walk through it word-by-word and puzzle it out, you may be able to get it.\nThis isn’t really an essay, per se. The Chinese have a different word for this type of “what I did that day” article: they call it 记事 (a record of events, like a diary) or 叙事 (a narrative). The weirdest part about this, I think, is the part where the kid says he smokes a cigarette his dad gave him. How old is this child? The rest of the piece makes it sound like he’s about 7-10? Anyway… The Chinese title of this little story is 放花炮.\n",

It set off a civilian firestorm which had a subversive impact on China’s art world towards the end of the last century, as it was the first time a music magazine’s content introduced the spirit of rebellion into the sphere of popular consciousness.

    "summary": "I apologize for not posting a month or so, I’ve been in the process of – ta da – moving back to China, so life’s been exciting but busy. On the upside, looks like I’ll have some interesting new posts from here. But today, in place of something interesting, we’ve got a slightly insipid story for young children about a bird who appears to have no head.\nNot sure what the life lesson is in this story or if it’s supposed to have one at all. Maybe “don’t gossip”? Or “don’t make wild assumptions?” Not sure. I’d say the most interesting word in here is 天哪, which means “My goodness!” This is used with relative frequency in China, and it’s a good interjection to use when you’re shocked or unpleasantly surprised about something but don’t want to swear or be offensive. For example, if you walked into a room that smelled badly, or if you were jostled by a few dozen people coming off the subway, or if you found out that something you want to buy is outrageously expensive. It doesn’t always have negative connotations, though – this can be used neutrally as well, but I rarely hear it used in a super positive context. Because the word 天 “Tian” ends with an “n” and the word 哪 “na” starts with one, this usually comes out sounding like “Tian ah!” rather than “Tian na”.\nAnother notable word here is 假如 jiā rú, which means “if”. Thing is, in Chinese, there are quite a few ways to say “if”. There’s the most common, which is 如果，there’s 要是，there’s 假使，若是，and so on. At a loss for a good explanation myself, I found a site that does a great job of summing this up. In short:\n1) expressing a fact: 要是你水烧到摄氏一百度就会沸腾, if you heat the water to 100 degrees celcius [then] it will boil.\n2) talking about a future result: 假如你认真学外语就会进步- if you study foreign language hard, it will improve.\n3)an imagined situation: 假使我很有钱，我就带她去很多地方- If I were rich,I would take her to so many places.\n4)if something didn’t happen: 如果你没迟到，我就不会那么生气 (if you weren’t late, I wouldn’t of been so mad.\n“ruguo” is more common than all of them. In a learning Chinese book you might only see “ruguo” and you would hear “ruguo” in daily speech. They are all correct to say, and you can use them interchangeably. However, i’d like to note that 要是 can also be used negatively if you place 不 in the middle, i.e. 要是 means “if” 要不是 means “If not..” such as 要不是你，我就不会来- If it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t come. Whereas “ruguo” and the others cannot be used in that way.\n",

    "summary": "Hoo boy, this song is an AWESOME find. Not only is it politically charged in the most amazing way, it’s ultra-beginner reading.\nBut first, a little back story so we all know what we’re reading here (and I do hope after this my blog stays available on the mainland – gonna use some weird spacing and spelling to avoid bots). The big campaign here right now is an expansion of the “Ha rmoni ous S *ocie\\ ty” campaign. It’s on every political poster on the roadsides – there are 20 such signs on my street alone. The point, basically, is to do your job in your place and not make waves, or make life uncomfortable for those around you. Sounds nice, but you can kind of see a little ways down that road, and you can understand why “harmo ny” has become a euphemism for ce n z*or*sh p. For example, whenever something “offensive” is, erm, stricken from the internet, Chinese sarcastically say that it has been “h-a r m onisd”. This concept goes right back to Confucius, whose big idea was that everyone has their duty and their place, and should follow a very strict set of rules governing what people in their position should and should not be able to do.\nSo the concept of har mony (和谐 – hé xié) has long been an integral part of Chinese culture, but it’s also been a point of criticism. Sadly, this whole “nail that sticks up gets hammered down” mentality is now giving the honchos a headache, because while the Chinese now have the manpower and the money to take the world economy by storm, they can’t get enough people to break away, be creative and innovate.\nAmusingly, the solution to this has apparently been to put signs up all over Beijing that say: “Beijing Spirit: Patriotism, Innovation, Inclusiveness, Morality.” So now, the message is “Don’t piss anyone off, but hurry up and do something unique”.\nGuess that solves that problem. NEXT!\nAnyway, the below is a children’s song that has probably been made up in the last few years, teaching children why harmony is so important. There are a couple of intermediate words in the last sentence, but they’re easy to figure out.\n",

    "summary": "Sweet! I found a bunch of Chinese riddles. Read the Chinese and try to guess the word! This is VERY short, lower-intermediate reading.\nSome of the riddles I found are impossible, because not only is the riddle hard, the answer is a kind of fruit or plant or thing I’ve never heard of, so I’m skipping past all those and over the next few days I’ll post a few riddles that are answerable for those of us who didn’t grow up in the southern Yao jungles or whatever.\nI think the most interesting word in this text is 青. I see this word everywhere, and I’ve never been able to come up with an English equivalent. It’s not green, and it’s not blue… well, it’s not actually a color. It means “the color that nature is”. It can be used to describe a clear green pond. It can be used to talk about trees or grass. So it’s not actually a specific hue, but the word is used as if it is. Someone feel free to dive in if you can think of a good translation for this.\nThis particular riddle kinda rhymes in Chinese, so when you’ve sorted out the words, read it out loud.\n",

    "englishText": "\nThe Zhao State was taking up arms against the Yan State, and Su Dai (a military strategist during the Warring States period, and little brother to Su Qin of the School of Diplomacy) traveled to speak with King HuiWen of Zhao on behalf of the Yan State, and he told the following fable: \n“When I was coming here I passed over some gentle water, and by chance I happened to see a clam sunning itself. A sandpiper seized the opportunity to peck at the clam’s meat, but the clam slammed the two wings of its hard shell shut on the sandpiper’s beak. The sandpiper said, ‘Today it won’t rain, tomorrow it won’t rain, and there will be one dead clam!’ The clam gave as good as he got, saying: ‘I won’t come out today, I won’t come out tomorrow (so your beak won’t be free), and there will be one dead sandpiper!’ Neither party was willing to give up, and at this time, a fisherman scooped them both up and carried them off. If Yan and Zhao oppose each other, we’ll both fight ourselves weary. I’m afraid the strong Qin State is playing the role of the fisherman, so I hope that your majesty will carefully deliberate on this matter.” \nKing HuiWen approved of SuDai’s message, and stopped using armed forces against the Yan State.\n",

    "summary": "This is the backstory behind the Chinese idiom 鹬蚌相争 yù bàng xiāng zhēng, which translates to “The Sandpiper and the Clam Fight Each Other”, and means “Two parties fight and a third party benefits.”\nCool upper-intermediate piece – in case it hasn’t been obvious throughout these posts, I love classical stories about wily government counselors and should probably post about something else on occasion, but so many classical tales involve this trope that it’s hard to avoid.\nThis piece is cool because – excepting the first sentence – the sentence structure is simple but there are quite a few classical words, so you’ll learn some historical terms. In case you think this kind of thing isn’t really useful, think again. Historical figures in the Chinese dynasties are mentioned frequently in the oddest places, and their stories bleed out into every medium. If you’re at a museum, if you’re reading Chinese magazines, if you’re reading Chinese historical essays, if you’re watching a TV show or book or listening to the radio, you’ll see mentions of historical dynasties all the time. But most importantly, if you want to watch Chinese war movies or period pieces (and there are some great ones), this vocab is crucial. You might as well know at least when to recognize that the conversation has gone that way.\nThis short story takes place during the Warring States period (475 BC to 221 BC), and mentions three of the seven warring kingdoms of that time, so you’ll learn some dynasty names: 赵国 zhào guó (The Zhao State), 燕国 yān guó (The Yan State), and 秦国 qín guó (the Qin State). Speaking of dynasties, when you’re reading this, look out for the word 王wáng – as you probably know at this point in your studies, 王means “king”, and when you see that, you can sometimes guess that the two or three characters before this word are the name of the king. Unlike in English, where we say “King Charles” or “King John”, in this case the Chinese put “king” after the name. For example, in this story, we have 赵惠文王 – King Huiwen of Zhao (in other words, king of the Zhao state).\nWhat’s amusing about this story is that in reality, the Qin Dynasty came out on top of the Warring States period and ruled China (well, for a decade or so, anyway) after the Warring States were over – so bear that in mind as you read the last sentence.\nYou’ll also meet our protagonist 苏代 sū dài – who he is is explained in the first sentence, but suffice to say that 苏代 is a person’s name. He’s mentioned in conjunction with 纵横家 zòng héng jiā, the School of Diplomacy, which was a sort of league of scholar-statesmen from the Warring States period. If you’re interested, you can read more about it on Wikipedia.\nAnyway, I’m making this story sound really complicated, but other than the historical terminology, the storyline is not at all convoluted.\nOriginal story is here: http://www.diyifanwen.com/chengyu/sizichengyugushi/20100516141051614035955767805.html\n",

    "englishText": "\nOn my birthday, my friend gave me a little “crystal bottle”, I really liked it, loved it so much I never wanted to part with it. \nThis “crystal bottle” twinkled very beautifully! Inside the crystal bottle, there were shining “crystal balls”. Those crystal balls were all shaped differently, and were all different colors. The one filled with a purple color was shaped like a star, the glistening yellow one was shaped like a football, the bright red one was shaped like a handbag, the shining clear one was shaped like a flute. These beautiful “crystal balls” contrasted with each other in a radiant profusion of light, dazzling to behold.\nInside each of the crystal balls, there was a very small “dancing stage” and on each exquisitely small, clinking stage there was a “dancer” — a crystal doll. The crystal dolls’ hands flashed, accompanying wonderful music, and [the dolls] rotated while standing on tiptoe, like graceful little elves dancing in the breeze. I watched and watched, intoxicated by the dancer’s elegant movements, and I couldn’t help but begin dancing with them. Whenever I watched them, all of my worries dropped away, vanishing beyond the topmost clouds. \nBut one day, and I don’t know why, I suddenly no longer liked to look at the crystal balls, and I put them somewhere in my closet, and it was only when that friend moved to a different school that I realized their importance. \nI like this crystal bottle because it was with me as I passed through a beautiful childhood, and it will always be with me as I go through life.\n",

    "summary": "This is possibly the girliest essay ever written, with crystals, dolls, little elfs and pretty colors described with great rapture. The writer is describing a gift given to her by a friend, which she loved as a child.\nThe sentence structure never gets too complex to follow in this, so if you’re an intermediate reader feeling up for a lot of new words, go for it. But this essay is a bit new-word heavy, so unless you are fairly good with descriptive vocabulary, don’t expect an uninterrupted read. I love this essay for its use of unusual color words, like “glistening yellow”, “vibrant red”, and “transparent”.\nIn terms of the item the author describes, it’s a bit hard to tell from the Chinese text that the writer is describing multiple crystal dolls inside of crystal balls in a crystal bottle until you get partway into the description, and while the girl paints a very vivid picture of this pretty bauble, I don’t know that I’ve ever seen anything like it in real life. It sounds like the crystal figurine version of Inception. Anyway, without further ado:\nThe Chinese title is: 　水晶球\n",

    "chineseText": "战国时，有个叫孟轲的人，大家称他为孟子。孟子善于通过打比方来发表议论。\n当时，有人指责孟子不尽力帮助齐王。孟子便解释说:“比如说，天下有些易活的植物，假如把它放在太阳下晒十天，然后再把它放在阴冷的地方冻十天，即使是生命力再强的植物也会死。我见到齐王的机会少之甚少，即使给了他些良好的影响与帮助，我一离开，一些和我主张不同的人，又带给他许多不好影响。我怎么能使齐王的思想、品质好起来呢？”\n",
    "englishText": "\nDuring the Warring States Period, there was a man named Meng Ke [Mencius], who everyone called MengZi. Menzi was very good at creating analogies to foster discussion.　\nAt that time, there was a person who criticized Mencius for not trying harder to help the King of Qi. Mencius explained plainly, saying, “Take this as an example: there are some plants that live well on this earth [lit: under heaven], but if you take them and put them in the sun to dry for ten days, then you take them and put them in the gloom and cold to freeze for ten days, even if their vitality is strong they’re still going to die.  My opportunities to see the King of Qi have been less and less, so even if I gave him some good influence and help, as soon as I leave, some people that don’t advocate the same things I do will influence him negatively. [That being the case,] how can I improve the quality of the King of Qi’s thinking?”\n",

    "summary": "This short tale addresses the background story behind the Chinese idiom 一暴十寒, which literally translates to “One day of sun, ten days of frost”, and which means “to bust butt for a little while and then get lazy”, or “to only work for a short time and then fail”. The story below really applies to the latter meaning. Though this is categorized as advanced, upper-intermediate readers could surely tackle this.\nThis story is a little odd, because the idiom 一暴十寒 means “ONE day of sun, TEN days of frost”, but the story references TEN days of sun and TEN days of frost – “one day of sun” is never mentioned. Which calls the whole “story behind the idiom” thing into question. Surely, some of the stories are truly historical, and have stayed with the Chinese people over several thousand years. Some are probably very very recent.\nNow, I spent a summer as an editor assistant in an educational publishing house in Beijing, and I can tell you a lot of these “historical stories” (when they’re used as language exercises, anyway) are just kind of made up to fit the word count needed.\nI was recently reading “Taoism: The Parting of the Way” by Holmes Welch, and he mentions an interesting phenomenon in Chinese scholarly history: several thousand years ago, some Chinese scholars or philosophers who wanted to get their ideas widely disseminated would write a book, then put the name of a dead but well-respected philosopher on it, and claim they had found a lost work by the other philosopher. Very clever, but it does confuse the historical record a bit.\nThese types of stories should be treated similarly – in many cases it’s impossible to tell where they came from. Sometimes there is a real historical tie-in to an old text, sometimes it’s all apocryphal – basically an urban legend. So, who knows if this idiom what made up my Mencius, made up by a scholar pretending to be Mencius, or made up by a school teacher to help students remember the text – either way, it’s a nice (and short) little blurb.\n",

The Chinese title is 小伞花.\nMost of this is beginner reading, but there is one part of a sentence towards the end of the text which is intermediate reading, so I’ve outlined the more difficult words there in the “click to listen” area.\nYou’ll also notice another onomatopoeia (I’ve been running into those a lot lately), 滴滴答答. We’re rather lucky when we describe sounds in English, we can mash a bunch of letters together until they sound similar to the sound we heard – we have a little more flexibility. I could write: pfffsssshhhh, and you could make that sound, or imagine that sound. The Chinese have no alphabet to work with, so they do this by taking existing characters that sound similar and arranging them together. In this case 滴滴答答 (di1 di1 da1 da1) represents the pattering of raindrops, as you might hear rain fall against a window or roof.\n",

    "englishText": "\nHonesty is the root of integrity! Sometimes honesty is based in an action, a spoken word. Cicero said that: “Forthrightness is a wonderful medicine that puts the heart at ease.” This is something I understand deeply from personal experience. During this year’s winter vacation, I [did something bad that meant I] was not a very honest child.　\nI remember on a busy winter break day, I was catching up on homework. Suddenly, I discovered that my essay book and my excerpt book had both been filled up [with writing], so carrying my money, I hurried downstairs to go buy notebooks. The old person [at the store] smiled kindly at me and asked: “Small friend, what do you want to buy?” I said: “I want to buy one essay book and one excerpt book.” “That will be a total of 5 yuan,” the old person said. I thought and thought, I only had 4 yuan, what should I do? Stuttering, I said, “I… I only have for yuan?” Talking over what to do with the shop owner, I said, “I live just above you, the next time I come down I’ll give you the rest of the money, OK?” “Ok,” he answered brightly. A few days passed, and again I went down to buy something, but the old person had forgotten the whole incident. I acted as if I had also forgotten.\nAfter I’d finished paying after the second time I went to buy something, I was about to leave to go back to my house. Suddenly, a good little angel and an evil little angel appeared in my mind, and they began to fight with each other. I listened to their differing words. The good little angel said, “You should speak up about this incident!” The evil little angel said, “Don’t mention it, if you mention it then you’ll have wasted 1 yuan.” The good angel said, “Don’t be a slave to money, be a master of honesty!” The evil little angel said, “What do you want to be an honest person for, you can’t eat honesty [lit: honesty can't be food].” They fought incessantly, and I was torn and confused, but at that moment I remembered the phrase I had read in a book, “Forthrightness is a wonderful medicine that puts the heart at ease.” \nI drummed up my courage, and forthrightly spoke up. At first, the old person’s face became red, and he seemed very angry. After a while, he said to me, “Don’t worry about it, I won’t blame you, you’re a child that corrects a mistake when he sees it!” At that very moment, tears welled up in my eyes, and I sincerely said to the old person, “I’m sorry, grandfather.” [not the author's real grandfather - this is a form of respect from a younger child to an older man.]\nAfter this, I understood, having integrity means you can’t cheat people, and I want to be an honest person! [The phrase] “A promise is worth a thousand gold” is so very important! Honesty is gold, and you can’t buy it back with money. \n",

    "summary": "This is a mid-level essay about learning to be honest. If you’ve read some of my other essay translations, you will start to see a pattern emerge in school essay writing. They usually include an all-too-tidy life lesson in morality, and usually an instance of tears welling up in the author’s eyes.\nWhen I was in Chinese class in college in China, my friends and I used to joke about this – how almost every essay we were assigned to read involved the author being moved to tears. We found this pattern especially strange because the Chinese people are not prone to crying in public – and if you do cry in front of a Chinese person you don’t know well, the polite thing for them to do is pretend not to notice and look the other way. Though that may seem heartless to a culture where the polite thing to do is get involved and try to comfort the crying person, the Chinese help a crying person save face by giving them the opportunity to pull themselves together and make the whole situation go away without comment.\nHowever, during funerals it is entirely acceptable to hire professional mourners, who fake-cry and sing sad songs while fake-sobbing and crawling on their knees in fake despair. Later during the funeral, the mourners will perform happy dances to lighten the mood – it’s almost like they guide the Chinese through the process of mourning and healing during the funeral. Though everyone there is aware the tears are faked for the benefit of performance, the Chinese find this very moving, whereas I think I would find it offensive if a stranger made a show of fake-crying at a funeral.\nPerhaps to a Chinese person, who knows that crying in front of others is, in most circumstances, too blatant a display of one’s secret inner self, the thought of someone being so upset that they lose control and cry in public shows just how upset they are, and is therefore moving. This is one thing I may never quite figure out.\nAnyway, this article has a lot less to do with crying than I’m leading you to believe, and more to do with integrity. This is a little more accessible than most articles because it includes a trope that we’re all familiar with: a variation of the devil and and angel sitting on opposite shoulders routine. This essay doesn’t use the word “devil”, instead it uses the term “evil angel”. This confusion is probably due to the fact that Christianity doesn’t get a lot of play in China. The only thing most Chinese know is that Islam, Christianity and Judaism are major world religions, and involve going to church, but that’s often about it. But Chinese mythology does have good and evil spirits in it, so I imagine that’s where the mixup comes in – well… if we’re going to get specific, technically Lucifer is an evil angel, but my point is that there is a Chinese word for “devil” (more like “a devil” than “the Devil”, though), 魔鬼, which does not appear here.\nThe Chinese title of this is 一诺千金.\n",

        "Honesty is the root of integrity! Sometimes honesty is based in an action, a spoken word. Cicero said that: “Forthrightness is a wonderful medicine that puts the heart at ease.” This is something I understand deeply from personal experience. During this year’s winter vacation, I [did something bad that meant I] was not a very honest child.　",
        "I remember on a busy winter break day, I was catching up on homework. Suddenly, I discovered that my essay book and my excerpt book had both been filled up [with writing], so carrying my money, I hurried downstairs to go buy notebooks. The old person [at the store] smiled kindly at me and asked: “Small friend, what do you want to buy?” I said: “I want to buy one essay book and one excerpt book.” “That will be a total of 5 yuan,” the old person said. I thought and thought, I only had 4 yuan, what should I do? Stuttering, I said, “I… I only have for yuan?” Talking over what to do with the shop owner, I said, “I live just above you, the next time I come down I’ll give you the rest of the money, OK?” “Ok,” he answered brightly. A few days passed, and again I went down to buy something, but the old person had forgotten the whole incident. I acted as if I had also forgotten.",
        "After I’d finished paying after the second time I went to buy something, I was about to leave to go back to my house. Suddenly, a good little angel and an evil little angel appeared in my mind, and they began to fight with each other. I listened to their differing words. The good little angel said, “You should speak up about this incident!” The evil little angel said, “Don’t mention it, if you mention it then you’ll have wasted 1 yuan.” The good angel said, “Don’t be a slave to money, be a master of honesty!” The evil little angel said, “What do you want to be an honest person for, you can’t eat honesty [lit: honesty can't be food].” They fought incessantly, and I was torn and confused, but at that moment I remembered the phrase I had read in a book, “Forthrightness is a wonderful medicine that puts the heart at ease.” ",
        "I drummed up my courage, and forthrightly spoke up. At first, the old person’s face became red, and he seemed very angry. After a while, he said to me, “Don’t worry about it, I won’t blame you, you’re a child that corrects a mistake when he sees it!” At that very moment, tears welled up in my eyes, and I sincerely said to the old person, “I’m sorry, grandfather.” [not the author's real grandfather - this is a form of respect from a younger child to an older man.]",
        "After this, I understood, having integrity means you can’t cheat people, and I want to be an honest person! [The phrase] “A promise is worth a thousand gold” is so very important! Honesty is gold, and you can’t buy it back with money. "

        "　　诚信是做人之本啊！有时候诚信就在于一个动作，一句语言，西塞罗曾经说过一句话: “坦白使人心地轻松的妙药”。这一句话我深有体会，今年寒假，我做了一个没有诚信的小孩子。",
        "　　记得在一个忙碌的寒假日，我赶着做作业。突然，我发现作文本和摘录笔用完了，我急急忙忙的拿着钱下楼买本子去了。那个老人用善良的微笑对我问道: “小朋友，你要买什么啊？”我说: “我要买一本作文本和一本摘录本。”“一共5元钱”老人说。我想了想，我只有4元钱，怎么办呢？我吞吞吐吐地说: “我…我只有4元钱啊？”怎么办，我和店主商量说: “我住在你们楼上，我下次再拿钱给你吧，好吗？”“好。”他爽快地答应了。过了几天，我又再次去买东西，那个老人忘记那件事情了。我似乎也忘了那件事。",
        "我付完了第二次买东西的钱后，我准备回家去了。突然，有一位善良的小天使和一位邪恶的小天使在我的脑海里出现了，它们在我的心中争吵。我听到了两种不同的语言。那位善良的小天使说: “你要把事实说出来啊！”那位邪恶的小天使说: “不要讲啊，如果讲出来要浪费一元钱呢。”那位善良的小天使说: “你不要做金钱的奴隶，要做诚信的主人啊！”那邪恶的小天使说:“干嘛要做有诚信的人啊，诚信又不能当饭吃啊！”他们不停地争吵，我心烦意乱的，这时我想起书上看到的这句子话；“坦白使人心地轻松的妙药”。",
        "　　我鼓足了勇气，坦白地说出来。开始时，老人脸涨得红红的，好像很生气似的。过了一会儿，他对我说: “没关系了，我不会怪你的，你是一个知错就改的孩子啊！”此时此刻，泪水盈满了我的眼眶，我诚恳地对那个老人说: “对不起，爷爷。”",
        "　　我从这件事，我明白了: 做人不能骗人，要做个有诚信的人啊！一诺千金是多么的重要啊！诚信是金，用多少钱都买不回来。"

    "englishText": "\n“The opposite of me” is about emotional entanglements in a love-hate relationship. Lynsey has a beautiful twin sister, Alex, who plays a very important role in her life, who makes her envious, and is someone she has jealously hated for 20 years. Alex has always been sexy and beautiful, radiant to look upon, and because of this easily gains the love of her parents and even strangers, a blessing Linsey has never had. When she’s with her sister, her sister’s presence is always regrettable. In “The Opposite of Me”, the main protagonist Linsey is a diligent student, a hard worker, and her careers success is the only thing she has. Her life has suffered at the expense of her work, but after all is said and done, she can’t shake off the fact that in this society, winning or losing doesn’t really depend on playing by the rules. When she’s betrayed at work, her career also sinks into an unprecedented crisis. \n　”The Opposite of Me” is also about the process of working through hardships, a comforting love story. Returning to her roots, Linsey still must face Alex’s dazzling radiance. Even the man who has liked her for 20 years, after meeting Alex by chance, changes his affections. Linsey complains about the unfairness of fate, and heaps this moodiness onto Alex’s shoulders. \n　　However, when bad luck comes to visit Alex, Linsey finally finds out that her feelings towards her sister are far from as simple as she thought. In order to fulfill her sister’s wish, Linsey climbs into the attic that has been closed for years, and unexpectedly discovers an old envelope that has been gathering dust for years; inside the envelope is a secret that has been hidden for almost 30 years. It changes the long-set course of her life, and raises a new wind in the lives of two sisters. \n",

    "englishText": "\nToday, mother came back from work, and very mysteriously said to me: “Cong cong, guess what I have bought for you?” I guessed many times, but mother repeatedly shook her head. Seeing my impatience, she took something from her backpack, I happily and excitedly took it from her and looked, ah! It was a pair of cute toy bears.\nThese two toy bears’ bodies were white as snow, they were pressed close together like a pair of dear sisters. Half-circle ears, small noses pointed outwards, a pair of eyes like two black pearls, chubby bodies, round head, all make them very lovable. \nMost interesting is that if you use your hand to pat their arms, they automatically play some sweet-sounding music, it’s really wonderful [lit: fun]! \nThese two toys are like my good friends, they accompany me every day, and they bring lots of fun to my family. I like my toy bears. \n",

Let’s take it piece by piece:\n让人 – Makes one / makes people / Causes people to feel (as in “That makes people mad.”)\n喜欢 – to like\n得 – Grammatical word tacked on to “喜欢 ” that can be loosely translated into “that is” or “they are”.\n不得了 – Extremely\nSo the whole phrase really means, “They’re extremely likeable”, but I’ve translated it a little more directly in the actual body of the translation so it’s easier to track with the sentence.\nAlso worth a quick mention is the word 胖乎乎, meaning “chubby”, but this word sounds very endearing, not insulting – a baby, for example, would be 胖乎乎.\nYou can find the original story on Tom61.\n",

        "中新网1月28日电据日本新闻网27日报道，日本警察厅发表消息说，越来越多的老人加入了小偷小摸的行列。在过去一年里，65岁以上老年人在超市和便利店等地方偷窃东西的人数比2009年增加了343人(增1.3%)，总数达到2万7362人，占到全体遭检举小偷总人数的26%，几乎与“小偷少年”(14-19岁)的总人数 (27%)相同。",
        "据称，在这些被抓的“小偷老人”行窃的原因里，有71.8%的人是因为想要这些东西却不愿意花钱买。还有13.2%的人是因为口袋里实在没钱买东西。还有0.9%的老人只是觉得好玩，有一种游戏的感觉。按照男女比例来分，女性小偷是48.2%，男性小偷是51.8%，比例几乎相近。",
        "报道说，这些老人偷窃的东西主要是食品。警察厅分析说，可能是这些老人对于自己今后的生活感到不安，怀着“节俭”的动机行窃。同时，调查也显示这些老人久居在家，没有社会的归属感，长期的孤独无助导致他们精神疲劳过度，而放松了对自制心。"

This is the formal / newspaper version of the word 说　shuō, both words meaning “to say”.\nIt’s also interesting to note that the phrase “脱口秀” – Talk show – is actually transliterated into Chinese from English. In other words, instead of translating its meaning into something like, “Talking Presenter Program” or similar, they used Chinese characters that sound similar to the English phrase “talk show” – tuō kōu xiù. This literally translates into “Blurt it out performance”, which I’d like to think is a way more accurate description of what usually happens on talk shows. Transliteration FTW.\n",

LiQuan wanted his mother to buy him a popsicle to eat, but mama said that eating a popsicle in cold weather would make his little stomach hurt. LiQuan said, “Then buy me a popsicle and we’ll take it back to the house and have grandma heat it up before I eat it.”\nONE LABEL\nMeimei had just begun her first year of school, and she was always losing her school supplies [lit: writing tools, such as pens, pencils, etc.], so her mother went and bought a lot of self-adhesive labels, stuck her [Meimei's] name on all her things, and told her seriously, “Whatever has your name stuck to it is yours. Now you won’t lose your things, and other people who pick them up can give them back to you.”\nMeimei promptly wrote out a label, stuck it on her mother’s cheek, then said to her father and older brother, “Mama is mine now, you can’t take her.”\nI WON’T LET YOU DIE\nSon: “Father, if I’m ever first in my class, what would you do?”\nFather: “Well, I’d be so happy I’d die!” \nSon: “Father, you don’t need to worry unnecessarily, I’m a filial son, I won’t let you die.”\n",

    "summary": "Well, not exactly one line, but close enough. These three jokes are meant for young kids, the type of thing you might find on the back of a kid’s cereal box.\nThe punchline of the last joke, “I Won’t Let You Die”, hinges on the Chinese slang [verb]死了 sǐle，which doesn’t actually have anything to do with death, but rather means “very”. For example, 饿死了, literally “die from hunger”, means “very hungry”, similar to the English phrase “I’m starving to death!” In this case, the phrase is 高兴死了, “happy to death”, or “very happy”.\n",

    "chineseText": "1840年，英国发行了世界第一枚邮票。它上面印了英国维多利亚女王的头像。因为这一枚邮票是黑色的，所以有“黑便士”之称。\n一百五十多年前的某一天，在英国的一个村子里，来了一辆由马儿拉动的邮车。那个时候，邮车到村里来送信是十分罕见的。所以，村里的人一听见马车声，便立刻从屋子里、田地里冲出来，围在邮车的周围。\n邮差走下车，手里高举着一封信，大声喊着: “爱里丝·布朗小姐，有信！”一个姑娘轻声地对邮差说: “我就是爱里丝·布朗。”人们的眼光都不约而同地投向她。\n爱里丝接过邮差给她的信，看了一看信封，便把信交还给邮差。“对不起。”她说，“我没有足够的钱付邮费。”\n人们都很同情她，不知道该说些什么话。突然间，人群里走出一个绅士模样的人，从口袋里拿出一些钱币，说要替爱里丝付邮费，可是爱里丝并不认识他。\n她带着感激的笑容对这位绅士说: “谢谢您的好意，先生，这封信我盼望了很久，可是现在我用不着它了。”\n“为什么呢？”那位绅士感到十分奇怪。\n“这封信是我的男朋友寄给我的。我们打算明年结婚。他为了筹钱结婚，只得到外地去找工作做。由于我付不起邮费，所以他事先交代我: 在信封上画个叉，是表示他的日子过得很好；画个圆圈，意思是他已经找到工作了。”\n“啊！原来这信封里是没有信的。”那位绅士自言自语地说: “这种情形很不合理，必须改善。”\n对于这件事情，他想了很久，终于想出了一个好办法。\n他向当时的英国政府建议: “邮费应该由寄信的人来付，而且也不应该太昂贵，否则穷人是付不起的。为了大家的方便，我认为寄信的人，用一个便士买一枚邮票，贴在信封上，这样寄出去就可以了。”\n结果，英国政府从善如流，接受了他的建议。这位绅士的名字叫罗兰·希尔世界上第一枚邮票就是这样诞生的。\n",
    "englishText": "\nIn 1840, England issued the world’s first postage stamp. The face of Queen Victoria was printed on it. Because the stamp was black, it was called the “Penny Black”.\nOne day more than one hundred and fifty years ago, a mail coach rode into a village in England. At that time, mail coaches rarely brought letters to the villages. So as soon as the village folks heard the sound of the carriage, they immediately rushed out of houses and fields to stand around the coach.\nThe postman stepped down from the coach holding up a letter and loudly cried, “Miss Alice Brown, you have a letter!” A girl’s light voice replied, “I’m Alice Brown.” Everyone’s gaze simultaneously went her way.\nAlice took the letter the postman handed her, looked at the envelope, and then gave the envelope back to the postman. “Sorry,” she said, “I don’t have enough money to pay the postage fee.”\nEveryone sympathized with her, and didn’t know what to say. Suddenly, a man of gentlemanly appearance walked out of the crowd, took some cash from his pocket, and said he wanted to pay the postal fee on Alice’s behalf, though Alice didn’t know him at all.\nWearing a proud smile, she told the gentleman, “Thank you for your kindness, mister, I’ve looked forward to this letter for a long time, but I have no use for it now.”\n“Why?” The gentlement thought this was quite strange.\n“This letter was sent to me by my boyfriend. I plan to marry him next year. To earn money for the marriage, he went away to look for work. Because I can’t pay any postage fees, before he left he told me: if he draws an X written on the envelope, it means he’s doing well, if there’s a circle on the envelope, it means he’s already found work.”\n“Ah! So actually there’s wasn’t any letter in the envelope to begin with.” The gentlemen mused out loud to himself, “This situation is unfair, [the mail system] must be improved.”\nHe thought about it for a long time, and finally thought of a solution.\nHe suggested to the then-government: “The postage fee should be paid by the sender of the letter, and it shouldn’t be too expensive, otherwise poor people won’t be able to afford it. For everyone’s convenience, I think people sending letters should use a one-penny stamp and stick it on the front of the letter – that’s how they can send it out.”\nAs a result, the English government were willing to follow this good advice and accepted his suggestion. This gentleman’s name was Rowland Hill, and this is how the world’s first postage stamp was born. \n",

    "summary": "Huh, learn something new every day. My entire understanding of the postal service comes from Terry Pratchett’s “Going Postal”, so it’s interesting to take a quick look into the [vaguely] factual history of the postage stamp.\nThis widely-circulated story is believed to be apocryphal, but Sir Rowland Hill was a very real postal reformer and inventor.\n",

        "In 1840, England issued the world’s first postage stamp. The face of Queen Victoria was printed on it. Because the stamp was black, it was called the “Penny Black”.",
        "One day more than one hundred and fifty years ago, a mail coach rode into a village in England. At that time, mail coaches rarely brought letters to the villages. So as soon as the village folks heard the sound of the carriage, they immediately rushed out of houses and fields to stand around the coach.",
        "The postman stepped down from the coach holding up a letter and loudly cried, “Miss Alice Brown, you have a letter!” A girl’s light voice replied, “I’m Alice Brown.” Everyone’s gaze simultaneously went her way.",
        "Alice took the letter the postman handed her, looked at the envelope, and then gave the envelope back to the postman. “Sorry,” she said, “I don’t have enough money to pay the postage fee.”",
        "Everyone sympathized with her, and didn’t know what to say. Suddenly, a man of gentlemanly appearance walked out of the crowd, took some cash from his pocket, and said he wanted to pay the postal fee on Alice’s behalf, though Alice didn’t know him at all.",
        "Wearing a proud smile, she told the gentleman, “Thank you for your kindness, mister, I’ve looked forward to this letter for a long time, but I have no use for it now.”",
        "“Why?” The gentlement thought this was quite strange.",
        "“This letter was sent to me by my boyfriend. I plan to marry him next year. To earn money for the marriage, he went away to look for work. Because I can’t pay any postage fees, before he left he told me: if he draws an X written on the envelope, it means he’s doing well, if there’s a circle on the envelope, it means he’s already found work.”",
        "“Ah! So actually there’s wasn’t any letter in the envelope to begin with.” The gentlemen mused out loud to himself, “This situation is unfair, [the mail system] must be improved.”",
        "He thought about it for a long time, and finally thought of a solution.",
        "He suggested to the then-government: “The postage fee should be paid by the sender of the letter, and it shouldn’t be too expensive, otherwise poor people won’t be able to afford it. For everyone’s convenience, I think people sending letters should use a one-penny stamp and stick it on the front of the letter – that’s how they can send it out.”",
        "As a result, the English government were willing to follow this good advice and accepted his suggestion. This gentleman’s name was Rowland Hill, and this is how the world’s first postage stamp was born. "

        "1840年，英国发行了世界第一枚邮票。它上面印了英国维多利亚女王的头像。因为这一枚邮票是黑色的，所以有“黑便士”之称。",
        "一百五十多年前的某一天，在英国的一个村子里，来了一辆由马儿拉动的邮车。那个时候，邮车到村里来送信是十分罕见的。所以，村里的人一听见马车声，便立刻从屋子里、田地里冲出来，围在邮车的周围。",
        "邮差走下车，手里高举着一封信，大声喊着: “爱里丝·布朗小姐，有信！”一个姑娘轻声地对邮差说: “我就是爱里丝·布朗。”人们的眼光都不约而同地投向她。",

        "她带着感激的笑容对这位绅士说: “谢谢您的好意，先生，这封信我盼望了很久，可是现在我用不着它了。”",
        "“为什么呢？”那位绅士感到十分奇怪。",
        "“这封信是我的男朋友寄给我的。我们打算明年结婚。他为了筹钱结婚，只得到外地去找工作做。由于我付不起邮费，所以他事先交代我: 在信封上画个叉，是表示他的日子过得很好；画个圆圈，意思是他已经找到工作了。”",
        "“啊！原来这信封里是没有信的。”那位绅士自言自语地说: “这种情形很不合理，必须改善。”",
        "对于这件事情，他想了很久，终于想出了一个好办法。",
        "他向当时的英国政府建议: “邮费应该由寄信的人来付，而且也不应该太昂贵，否则穷人是付不起的。为了大家的方便，我认为寄信的人，用一个便士买一枚邮票，贴在信封上，这样寄出去就可以了。”",
        "结果，英国政府从善如流，接受了他的建议。这位绅士的名字叫罗兰·希尔世界上第一枚邮票就是这样诞生的。"

    "englishText": "\nDuring the Spring and Autumn period, Nobleman ZhiBo of the Jin state eliminated the Fan clan [in battle]. There was a person who sought to take advantage of the defeated [and thus absent] Fan clan to steal some things from their house, and he saw that in their yard dangled a large bell. The bell was molded from the finest bronze, its shape and design were very fine indeed. The thief was extremely happy, thinking to take this refined bell and carry it back to his own house. But the bell was both big and heavy, and howsoever he tried, he couldn’t move it. He thought and thought, and came up with just one solution, which was to break the bell to bits, then take the pieces separately back to his house.\n\n　　\n\nThe thief found a sledgehammer, and swung at the bell with all his might. A loud “gong” sound rang out, startling the thief. The thief panicked, thinking this [enterprise] was spoiled, thinking “that kind of noise is tantamount to telling people that I’m here stealing the bell, isn’t it?” He was worried, and he flung is body at the bell, stretching his arms around it to try to still the sound, but really how could he stop it? The sound went on and on, ringing far and wide.  \nThe longer he heard it, the more afraid he became, and withdrew his hands to press them against his ears with all his strength. “Yi, the sound has lessened, I can’t hear it anymore!” The thief became happy again, “How wonderful! If I cover my ears well, the sound can’t be heard!” covered his ears well, he couldn’t hear the sound at all! He immediately found two pieces of cloth and stopped up his ears, thinking that this way, no one else could hear the bell’s sound either. So he began smashing the bell, hitting it again and again, the ringing of the bell being heard even in far away places. People heard the bells sounds and came in great numbers, catching the thief.  \n",

    "englishText": "\nAfter an accidental airport meeting, Carol and Jason fell in love at first sight, loving each other like two months to a flame, hurting each other in their infatuation, and yet feeling increasing tenderness for each other in their pain. Strong and determined Carol doesn’t dare believe in true love due to having been abandoned by her father; gentle and considerate Jason, because a woman previously killed herself over him, suffers from a “serious inability to love”. The two of them are mutually attracted, yet avoid each other, each knowing that they can’t reciprocate the love, but also both unable to convince themselves to walk away from it. When Carol finally becomes determined to face her love, tragedy descends upon Jason…\n",

    "summary": "Ah, bless romance novels – they’re the same in every language. This short synopses introduces 致命的温柔, “The Gentleness of Self-Sacrifice”, a book by Chinese author 艾米.\nThe very first clause here, 一次偶然的接机, presents a little conundrum, particularly the term 接机, which generally translates into “picking someone up”, and “airplane”. Whether this means that Carol and Jason met while both picking up someone else, or one was getting off the plane while the other was picking someone up seems unspecified.\n",

    "englishText": "\nLong, long ago, a poor farmer and his wife had their 7th child at the age of 70, so they named him “QiXi” [Seventh Happiness]. Of course, QiXi was a kind, smart and happy child, but he turned out rather strangely, with a round body, huge head, but no hands or feet… the only way he could “walk” was to roll along. QiXi’s good friend was a firefly who said that at the end of the earth, at the very edge of the sea, there was a place called the Golden Coast, and among ten thousand banyan trees, in one particular tree trunk there lived a doctor who might be able to change his [QiXi's] life…. however, in order to get there, of course they must pass through many places and above all, cross the sea, where there are many killers….      \n",

    "englishText": "\nThe day before yesterday, I did a bad thing. YunXi brought her beloved stamp album in to let her classmates see it. Her stamp album contains her collected stamps from places all around the world, such as Europe, China, Malaysia, etc. The other students looked through it, going on and on about it. I envied YunXi, because she had stamps from all over the world, and me? My stamp album only has a few stamps from local letters my dad got. When class let out, I took advantage of the situation and took the stamp album from YunXi’s book bag. After a while, I walked back and lined up in the assembly hall, pretending nothing had happened. When we’d gotten back to the classroom, YunXi opened her book bag and didn’t see her stamp album, and she burst into tears. Teacher Lin asked her what happened, YunXi told the teacher the reason. \nTeacher Lin questioned all the students, asking who had taken Lu YunXi’s stamp album. The teacher inquired for a long time, but no one was willing to admit to it. I felt ashamed, got the stamp album, and admitted my error to YunXi. The teacher saw that I was brave enough to admit my mistake and so didn’t punish me, just lectured me for a bit, and YunXi accepted my apology. I regretted what I’d done. I told myself that next time I would carefully consider the results of my actions so as to avoid a big mistake! \n",

    "summary": "This short essay details a child’s brush with classroom thievery.\nIn my opinion, one of the most interesting sentences here is “同学们看了都称不绝口”, meaning “The students all looked [at it], talking continuously.” This is easy to translate directly, but a direct translation doesn’t capture the spirit of the sentence. In context, this sentence is tinged with a little envy – the author sees the other students all looking at YunXi’s stamp album, going on and on, presumably about how great the album is, and so the author is jealous.\n",

        "The day before yesterday, I did a bad thing. YunXi brought her beloved stamp album in to let her classmates see it. Her stamp album contains her collected stamps from places all around the world, such as Europe, China, Malaysia, etc. The other students looked through it, going on and on about it. I envied YunXi, because she had stamps from all over the world, and me? My stamp album only has a few stamps from local letters my dad got. When class let out, I took advantage of the situation and took the stamp album from YunXi’s book bag. After a while, I walked back and lined up in the assembly hall, pretending nothing had happened. When we’d gotten back to the classroom, YunXi opened her book bag and didn’t see her stamp album, and she burst into tears. Teacher Lin asked her what happened, YunXi told the teacher the reason. ",
        "Teacher Lin questioned all the students, asking who had taken Lu YunXi’s stamp album. The teacher inquired for a long time, but no one was willing to admit to it. I felt ashamed, got the stamp album, and admitted my error to YunXi. The teacher saw that I was brave enough to admit my mistake and so didn’t punish me, just lectured me for a bit, and YunXi accepted my apology. I regretted what I’d done. I told myself that next time I would carefully consider the results of my actions so as to avoid a big mistake! "

    "englishText": "\nLong ago, there was a married woman who brought her daughter to live in a beautiful garden planted with many cabbages. In winter, a rabbit came to the garden and stole the cabbages to eat. Mama said to her daughter, “Go chase that rabbit away.” The girl went outside and said to the rabbit, “Wei! Rabbit, you’ll soon eat up all of our cabbage!” The rabbit said to the girl, “Young lady, come sit on my tail, I’ll take you to my house.” \nBut the girl was unwilling.\nOn the second day, the rabbit came to eat the cabbages again. Mama again said to her daughter, “Go into the garden and drive that rabbit away.” The girl went outside and said to the rabbit, “Wei! Rabbit, you’ll soon eat up all of our cabbage!” The rabbit said to the girl, “Young lady, come sit on my tail, I’ll take you to my house.” But the girl still refused. \nOn the third day, the rabbit came again, and sat on top of the cabbage. The mother said to her daughter, “Go chase that rabbit away.” So the girl went outside and said, “Wei! Rabbit, you’ll soon eat up all of our cabbage!” The rabbit said to the girl, “Young lady, sit on my tail and I’ll take you to my house.” The girl sat on the rabbit’s tail and was taken to the rabbit’s house far away. He said to the girl, “Now get started with the cooking, use green vegetables and millet, I’ll go invite guests to the wedding.” Presently, all the guests arrived (and who were the guests? I’ll tell you what I heard from someone else: They were all rabbits! A dairy cow was the pastor, who took charge of the wedding for the bride and groom; and a fox was the master of ceremonies, with his altar set beneath a rainbow).\nThe girl was very sad, because only she was human. The rabbit approached her and said, “Open the door, open the door, hurry and open the door, the guests are very interested [in seeing you].” The unwitting bride [lit: girl who was being treated as a bride] began sobbing without saying anything, and the rabbit went away. When he came back again, he said, “Serve the food, serve the food, hurry and serve the food, the guests are all very hungry.” The girl, crying to herself, still didn’t make a peep, and the rabbit again went away. The third time he came back, he said to the girl, “Uncover the saucepan, quick uncover the pot, the guests are getting impatient.” The bride remain uncommunicative, and the rabbit went away again. So the girl took her own clothes and put them on a scarecrow, put a spoon in its hand so that it appeared to be stirring the boiling pot, then positioned him next to the pot, and then she went back home to her mother.  \nThe rabbit came back again and yelled, “Hurry and serve the food, hurry and serve the food!” Then he stood up and raised a fist to the girl, and consequently knocked the scarecrow’s hat off.  \nWhen the rabbit found out that this wasn’t his bride, he sadly went away from there. \n",

    "summary": "A slightly nonsensical fairy tale about a young woman and a cabbage-stealing rabbit that wants to marry her.\nOne of the interesting grammatical points in this story is the phrase 吃光 chī guāng. We know that chī means “to eat”, but guāng typically means “to be bright” – so what are those two words doing next to each other? A secondary meaning of the word guāng is “to finish”, or “to use up”. It’s usually placed after a verb to indicate that the verb was done until it couldn’t be done any more, or until something was gone – in this case “to eat up”.\nAnother interesting word here is the word 动手 dòng shǒu, literally “move hands”. In this case, it means “get going”, or “get started working [on something]“, as in the phrase 现在动手烧饭吧, or “Start cooking now”.\nI’d imagine the most confusing piece of this text is the last sentence of the paragraph that begins “第三天…”. Within the parentheses, the tone of the story randomly changes. This should be read as the first (and only) interjection by the story’s narrator, who elaborates on what kind of animals attended the wedding.\n",

    "englishText": "\nLittle Gull was very beautiful, and she set great store by her appearance.\nIn the mornings, Little Gull would flap her wings and fly out onto the ocean.  The ocean was her mirror, and she went there every day to wash and make herself up.\nLooking into the mirror [lit: opposite the mirror], Little Gull would gaze, and stare, twisting this way and that and combing her feathers. She thought she was the most beautiful girl under the sun.\nJust when she was feeling quite proud of herself, she heard some piercing screeches coming from the vicinity of a seaside rock: “Show off! Show off!”, chattered a bunch of nest-making swifts, “You don’t work, no one likes you!”\n“Hmph! You’re just jealous of me!” said Little Gull, refusing to accept the truth, and she continuing to turn about in the mirror.\nAt noon, Little Gull flew out to a reef, and began to peck at some fish she found drying in the sun. Suddenly, a swallow ran up to her and said, “Hey lazybones! Don’t eat that, we [swallows] caught that fish!”\nLittle swallow sat on the reef and cried, cried from such sadness! The gull she saw in the mirror didn’t look at all beautiful.\nThe great Sea Mother said to her, “To work is one of the noblest virtues. Why don’t you go work with them?”  Little Gull nodded her head.\nAfter that, the ranks of worker seabirds grew by one, and that one was Little Gull.  \n",

    "summary": "Like most children’s fables, this story features a simple sentence structure, but an upper-intermediate word list, perfect for picking up a lot of vocabulary and a couple of tame colloquialisms.\nThe most difficult paragraph here is probably the fourth, particularly the part: 几句刺耳的话从海岸的岩石那边儿飞过来. We can break this down this way:\n几句 – Several sentences [of]\n刺耳的话 – Ear-piercing words\n从海岸的岩石那边 – From a seashore rock direction (from the direction of a seaside rock)\n飞过来 – Flew in (in this case, this is best translated as “drifted over”.)\nThis tells us that there was more than one speaker, in this case the nest of swifts, who are screeching at Little Gull from nearby.\n",

    "englishText": "\nBing Xin is a famous modern Chinese writer who represents all her countrymen. Her last name is Xie, BingXin is her pen name, so there are still some people that call her Xie BingXin.\nBingXin is a southerner. She was born in the year 1900, and by the time she began primary school, she’d already read quite a few works of ancient Chinese literature. In 1914, she attended a Christian girl’s high school in Beijing. During the May 4th Movement, she was attending college in Beijing, and she participated in the student movement of that time. At the same time, she also began writing novels and modern poetry. In 1921, she participated in the famous “Literature Research Conference”. In 1923, she left to study abroad in America. In America, she researched literature, and at the same time wrote down the things she saw and heard overseas, sending them back to China. These works later became the basis of the  book “To Young Readers”. \nIn 1926, BingXin returned from abroad. After she returned, she worked at Beijing University teaching Chinese literature. From 1929 to 1933 she wrote the novels “Segregation”, “Aunt”, etc., and at the same time translated the works of a few foreign writers. In 1945, BingXin went to Japan. From 1949 to 1951, she taught Chinese literature at Tokyo University, returning home in autumn of 1951. In 1958, the “People’s Daily” published her work “To Young Readers 2″. BingXin wasn’t only a literature expert, she was also a teacher. She loved children, she loved the offspring of her motherland, and she used her writings to teach children.\nIn my third year of high school, I read her early poem “Spring Water”. It was written beautifully and was very moving. After that, I always loved to read BingXin’s novels. My college thesis was “On the Aesthetic Style of BingXin’s Novels”. After I graduated college, I went to work for a publishing company. One summer morning this year, I got the opportunity to interview this master writer who is still with us today. That day was cloudy, cold, and rainy. I got up extremely early, put on a light blue suit, got on the bus and at 8:30 arrived at BingXin’s house.\nBingXin’s house was fairly far from the city center, near XinJieKou [a subdivision of Beijing]. She lived in a Beijing retirement community. There were many flowers in the yard.\nBingXin met me in the living room. The living room wasn’t big, was very clean, and a landscape painting was hanging on the wall. The living room bookshelf held all kinds of books, some were in Chinese, and some were in foreign languages. BingXin had white hair, was short of stature and very thin, but looking at her she didn’t seem like someone who was in her nineties. After we met, I first enquired after her health. She said that she was rarely sick, and though sometimes she caught cold, a little medicine fixed her right up. When I asked her why she was still so healthy, she said it’s because of frequent exercise. \nLater, she answered a few of my questions about literature in the thirties. She drank tea as she spoke. When she touched on the topic of modern literature, I asked her, “Do you still write?” She said, “I want to! It’s just that my eyes aren’t so good, I can’t write anymore. Every day I just read the paper or a magazine or something.” When I asked her why she had gone abroad to study, she asked me, “Have you been abroad?” I said, “No.” She said to me, “Go have a look if you have the opportunity, work for a year or two in another country. People who’ve lived abroad know what patriotism means.”\nThat day, when I got back to my house, I kept thinking about that one thing she’d said: “People who’ve lived aborad know what patriotism means.”\n",

    "summary": "This one-page lower-intermediate essay covers the biography of BingXin, a famous authoress from the early 1900′s. The essay writer also chronicles an interview he did with BingXin, and records some parts of their discussion.\nThis is definitely lower-intermediate reading, with uncomplicated sentence structure and mostly simple words with a few zingers thrown in for good measure. If you’re an advanced-beginner student and feel up to a challenge, this would be a great exercise to work on.\nYou’ll see breif mention made of 五四运动 wǔ sì yùn dòng, the May 4th Movement, a period of student protests against the Treaty of Versailles. During that time, China began to see an upsurge in nationalism, and a heavier focus on respecting the working man over the ivory tower intellectual.\n",

        "Bing Xin is a famous modern Chinese writer who represents all her countrymen. Her last name is Xie, BingXin is her pen name, so there are still some people that call her Xie BingXin.",
        "BingXin is a southerner. She was born in the year 1900, and by the time she began primary school, she’d already read quite a few works of ancient Chinese literature. In 1914, she attended a Christian girl’s high school in Beijing. During the May 4th Movement, she was attending college in Beijing, and she participated in the student movement of that time. At the same time, she also began writing novels and modern poetry. In 1921, she participated in the famous “Literature Research Conference”. In 1923, she left to study abroad in America. In America, she researched literature, and at the same time wrote down the things she saw and heard overseas, sending them back to China. These works later became the basis of the  book “To Young Readers”. ",
        "In 1926, BingXin returned from abroad. After she returned, she worked at Beijing University teaching Chinese literature. From 1929 to 1933 she wrote the novels “Segregation”, “Aunt”, etc., and at the same time translated the works of a few foreign writers. In 1945, BingXin went to Japan. From 1949 to 1951, she taught Chinese literature at Tokyo University, returning home in autumn of 1951. In 1958, the “People’s Daily” published her work “To Young Readers 2″. BingXin wasn’t only a literature expert, she was also a teacher. She loved children, she loved the offspring of her motherland, and she used her writings to teach children.",
        "In my third year of high school, I read her early poem “Spring Water”. It was written beautifully and was very moving. After that, I always loved to read BingXin’s novels. My college thesis was “On the Aesthetic Style of BingXin’s Novels”. After I graduated college, I went to work for a publishing company. One summer morning this year, I got the opportunity to interview this master writer who is still with us today. That day was cloudy, cold, and rainy. I got up extremely early, put on a light blue suit, got on the bus and at 8:30 arrived at BingXin’s house.",
        "BingXin’s house was fairly far from the city center, near XinJieKou [a subdivision of Beijing]. She lived in a Beijing retirement community. There were many flowers in the yard.",
        "BingXin met me in the living room. The living room wasn’t big, was very clean, and a landscape painting was hanging on the wall. The living room bookshelf held all kinds of books, some were in Chinese, and some were in foreign languages. BingXin had white hair, was short of stature and very thin, but looking at her she didn’t seem like someone who was in her nineties. After we met, I first enquired after her health. She said that she was rarely sick, and though sometimes she caught cold, a little medicine fixed her right up. When I asked her why she was still so healthy, she said it’s because of frequent exercise. ",
        "Later, she answered a few of my questions about literature in the thirties. She drank tea as she spoke. When she touched on the topic of modern literature, I asked her, “Do you still write?” She said, “I want to! It’s just that my eyes aren’t so good, I can’t write anymore. Every day I just read the paper or a magazine or something.” When I asked her why she had gone abroad to study, she asked me, “Have you been abroad?” I said, “No.” She said to me, “Go have a look if you have the opportunity, work for a year or two in another country. People who’ve lived abroad know what patriotism means.”",
        "That day, when I got back to my house, I kept thinking about that one thing she’d said: “People who’ve lived aborad know what patriotism means.”"

        "冰心是中国现代著名女作家，全国人大代表。　她姓谢，冰心是她的笔名，所以也有人叫她谢冰心。",
        "冰心是南方人，1900年出生，上小学时就已经读了不少中国古代的文学作品。　1914年她到北京一所教会女子中学读书。　五四运动时，她在北京上大学，参加了当时的学生运动。　同时，她也开始写作小说和现代诗。　1921年她参加了当时有名的”文学研究会”。　1923年她到美国去留学。　在美国，她一是研究文学，二是把在国外的见闻写出来， 寄回国内发表， 这就是后来的 《寄小读者》一书。",
        "1926年冰心回国。回国后她在北京大学工作，教中国文学。 1929年到1933年她写有小说《分 》，《姑姑》等，同时还翻译了一些外国作家的作品。 1945年冰心去日本。 1949年到1951年她在东京大学教中国文学，1951年秋回国。 1958年《人民日报》发表了她的《再寄小读者》。 冰心不但是文学家，而且还是个教育家。 她非常爱孩子，爱祖国的后代，她用她的作品来教育孩子们。",
        "在上中学三年级时我就读过她的早年诗作《春水》。 她的诗写得好美，非常感人。 后来，我一直喜欢看冰心的小说。 我大学的毕业论文就是《论冰心小说的美学风格》。大学毕业后我到一家报社工作。 今年夏天的一个上午，我有机会访问了这位还健在的老作家。 那天是阴天，气温不高，下着小雨。 早晨我起得特别早，穿了件浅蓝色的西服，坐公共汽车八点半就到了冰心家。",
        "冰心家里市中心比较远，在新街口附近。 她住的是北京一所老师的院子，院子里种的很多花儿。",
        "冰心是在客厅里会见的我。 客厅不大，很干净，墙上挂着一张山水画。 客厅书架上放着许多书，有中文的，也有外文的。 冰心一头白发，个子不高，瘦瘦的，看上去，不像是九十来岁的人。 一见面，我先问候了一下她的身体。 她说，他很少得病，有时候得了感冒，吃点儿药就好了。 我问她为什么还这么健康时，她说，就是经常锻炼身体。",
        "后来，她回答了我几个有关三十年代文学的问题。 他一边喝茶，一边说。 当她进到当代文学时，我问他， “现在还写东西吗?” 她说，“想写啊！ 就是眼睛不好了，写不动了。 每天就是看看报和杂志什么的。“ 当我问她当年为什么去美国留学时，她问我，“你出国了吗？” 我说，“没有。” 她对我说，“有机会要出去看看，在国外工作一两年。 在国外生活过的人就知道什么是爱国了。”",
        "那天回到家，我一直想着她说的那句话，“在国外生活过的人就知道什么是爱国了“。"

    "englishText": "\nI’m sick. My head hurts, I have a fever, my throat also hurts, I don’t want to eat anything, and at night I have a serious cough. In the morning my classmates all went to class, and I was the only one left in the dormitory. I feel very lonely. When you’re lonely, it’s easy to miss home. I have a lot of family members – an older brother, older sister, and also a younger brother. When I’m at home, we often play together. Right now, I’m in Beijing studying Chinese, and when I’m lonely I miss them.\nBecause I don’t feel well, I got up late today. When I got up, I went to the hospital. The doctor gave me a quick checkup and said I have a cold. He gave me one shot [also: IV drip], and also prescribed some medicine. He said, take the medicine and you’ll get better.\nMy teacher and classmates know I’m sick, so they all came to see me. Teacher Lin heard that I didn’t want to eat anything, so she made me a bowl of noodles. After I ate the noodles, I began to pour sweat. Teacher said, if you sweat, maybe your fever will go away.\nIn the afternoon, sure enough my fever was gone, and I was in a good mood. I emailed my older sister. I said, I have a very good life here, I have a good teacher and good classmates and good friends, and all together they make me very happy.\n",
    "extra": "Interesting Vocabulary\n发烧 – fā shāo – Have a fever\n咳嗽 – ké sou – Cough\n同学 – tóng xué – Classmates\n寂寞 – jì mò – Lonely\n不舒服 – bù shū fu – Feel unwell, uncomfortable\n检查 – jiǎn chá – Check, examine\n果然 – guǒ rán – Sure enough\n",
    "summary": "A passage from a BLCU textbook in which a university student laments about catching a cold. This essay focuses on mostly illness-centric beginner language, such as 感冒 gǎn mào, meaning “to have a cold”， and 打针 dǎ zhēn, meaning “to get an IV drip or shot”.\nLest it seems a little dramatic to you that the writer would go to the hospital over a 24-hour cold, the Chinese typically don’t use private clinics (except in the case of accupuncture and massage), and commonly go to the hospital for almost every health-related issue, including colds and small fevers.\nOf special interest is the phrase “还开了一些药”, or “and also prescribed me some medicine”. Literally, it says, “Also opened a bit of medicine”. But the word 开 kāi, which usually means “open”, is also the verb used to describe a doctor writing a perscription. This tells us that the doctor didn’t give (给gěi) the student any medicine himself, but perscribed it instead.\n",

    "chineseText": "从前有一个人，从魏国到楚国去。他带上很多的盘缠，雇了上好的车，驾上骏马，请了驾车技术精湛的车夫，就上路了。楚国在魏国的南面，可这个人不问青红皂白让驾车人赶着马车一直向北走去。\n路上有人问他的车是要往哪儿去，他大声回答说: “去楚国！”路人告诉他说: “到楚国去应往南方走，你这是在往北走，方向不对。那人满不在乎地说:”没关系，我的马快着呢!” 路人替他着急，拉住他的马，阻止他说, “方向错了，你的马再快，也到不了楚国呀!” 那人依然毫不醒悟地说: “不要紧，我带的路费多着呢!” 路人极力劝阻他说:“虽说你路费多，可是你走的不是那个方向，你路费多也只能白花呀!” 那个一心只想着要到楚国去的人有些不耐烦地说: “这有什么难的，我的车夫赶车的本领高着呢!” 路人无奈，只好松开了拉住车把子的手，眼睁睁看着那个盲目上路的魏人走了。\n那个魏国人，不听别人的指点劝告，仗着自己的马快、钱多、车夫好等优越条件，朝着相反方向一意孤行。那么，他条件越好，他就只会离要去的地方越远，因为他的大方向错了。\n这个故事告诉我们，无论做什么事，都要首先看准方向，才能发充分挥自己的有利条件；如果方向错了，那么有利条件只会起到相反的作用。\n",
    "englishText": "\nLong ago, there was a man traveling from the Kingdom of Wei to the Kingdom of Chu. He took a lot of traveling money with him, hired a good carriage, harnessed it to a strong steed, hired an exquisitely skilled driver, and then began his journey. The Kingdom of Chu was to the south of the Kingdom of Wei, but this man couldn’t tell the difference when the driver rode away towards the north.\nOn the road, a passing traveler asked where they were going. The man loudly answered, “We’re going to the Kindom of Chu!”. The traveler told him, “If you’re going to Chu, you should go south. You’re going north, it’s the wrong direction.” The man unconcernedly replied, “No problem! My horse is very fast.” Worried for him, the traveler pulled at the horse, and warned, “You’re going the wrong way. Even if your horse was even faster than it is, you still won’t reach the Kingdom of Chu!” Still not seeing the truth, the man said, “Don’t worry, I’ve brought a lot of money with me.” Making a concerted effort to dissuade him, the traveler said, “Though you may have a lot of money, you’re still going the wrong direction, and your money will be spent in vain.” Thinking of nothing other than getting to the Kingdom of Chu, the man impatiently said, “It’s not a problem, my driver is extremely skilled!” Out of options, the traveler let go of the carriage and watched helplessly as the aimless man from Wu rode away.\nThe man from Wu didn’t listen to anyone’s exhortations, relying on his fast horse, his money, his driver’s skill and many other favorable conditions, and obstinately continued to go in the opposite direction. Doing this, he could only continue to get further and further away from his goal, because his overall direction was wrong.\nThis story tells us, no matter what the situation is, we’d better first be sure we’re going the right way, and only then can we fully employ our other advantages, otherwise those advantages will just cause us pain [lit: have the opposite effect].\n",

        "Long ago, there was a man traveling from the Kingdom of Wei to the Kingdom of Chu. He took a lot of traveling money with him, hired a good carriage, harnessed it to a strong steed, hired an exquisitely skilled driver, and then began his journey. The Kingdom of Chu was to the south of the Kingdom of Wei, but this man couldn’t tell the difference when the driver rode away towards the north.",
        "On the road, a passing traveler asked where they were going. The man loudly answered, “We’re going to the Kindom of Chu!”. The traveler told him, “If you’re going to Chu, you should go south. You’re going north, it’s the wrong direction.” The man unconcernedly replied, “No problem! My horse is very fast.” Worried for him, the traveler pulled at the horse, and warned, “You’re going the wrong way. Even if your horse was even faster than it is, you still won’t reach the Kingdom of Chu!” Still not seeing the truth, the man said, “Don’t worry, I’ve brought a lot of money with me.” Making a concerted effort to dissuade him, the traveler said, “Though you may have a lot of money, you’re still going the wrong direction, and your money will be spent in vain.” Thinking of nothing other than getting to the Kingdom of Chu, the man impatiently said, “It’s not a problem, my driver is extremely skilled!” Out of options, the traveler let go of the carriage and watched helplessly as the aimless man from Wu rode away.",
        "The man from Wu didn’t listen to anyone’s exhortations, relying on his fast horse, his money, his driver’s skill and many other favorable conditions, and obstinately continued to go in the opposite direction. Doing this, he could only continue to get further and further away from his goal, because his overall direction was wrong.",
        "This story tells us, no matter what the situation is, we’d better first be sure we’re going the right way, and only then can we fully employ our other advantages, otherwise those advantages will just cause us pain [lit: have the opposite effect]."

        "从前有一个人，从魏国到楚国去。他带上很多的盘缠，雇了上好的车，驾上骏马，请了驾车技术精湛的车夫，就上路了。楚国在魏国的南面，可这个人不问青红皂白让驾车人赶着马车一直向北走去。",
        "路上有人问他的车是要往哪儿去，他大声回答说: “去楚国！”路人告诉他说: “到楚国去应往南方走，你这是在往北走，方向不对。那人满不在乎地说:”没关系，我的马快着呢!” 路人替他着急，拉住他的马，阻止他说, “方向错了，你的马再快，也到不了楚国呀!” 那人依然毫不醒悟地说: “不要紧，我带的路费多着呢!” 路人极力劝阻他说:“虽说你路费多，可是你走的不是那个方向，你路费多也只能白花呀!” 那个一心只想着要到楚国去的人有些不耐烦地说: “这有什么难的，我的车夫赶车的本领高着呢!” 路人无奈，只好松开了拉住车把子的手，眼睁睁看着那个盲目上路的魏人走了。",
        "那个魏国人，不听别人的指点劝告，仗着自己的马快、钱多、车夫好等优越条件，朝着相反方向一意孤行。那么，他条件越好，他就只会离要去的地方越远，因为他的大方向错了。",
        "这个故事告诉我们，无论做什么事，都要首先看准方向，才能发充分挥自己的有利条件；如果方向错了，那么有利条件只会起到相反的作用。"

When Little Wolf ran into a  mountain cave and looked, he saw that it was Little Fox that was cooking the fish. Fox saw that Wolf had come, and in his heart he was secretly happy.\nWolf asked “Where did these fish come from?”\nFox said, “There is a place where you can catch many fish, I can take you there.”\nSo Wolf followed Fox as he walked and walked, until they came to a riverbank. There turned out to be a layer of ice over the water.\nFox said, “All you have to do is bore a hole in the ice, stick your tail into the river, wait until the fish bite your tail, then pull your tail out. This way, you’ll catch many, many fish.\nWolf, thinking of how the fish would be more than a full meal, waited quite a while, but no fish bit his tail. Wolf was finally too cold to continue and tried to pull up his tail, but when he turned his head to look, he saw that his tail was stuck in the ice. He gave a  great pull, and what do you know but his tail came off with a “pa”  sound. Wolf fled.\nWhen the other little animals saw wolf’s miserable face, they all laughed.\n",

        "Wolf, thinking of how the fish would be more than a full meal, waited quite a while, but no fish bit his tail. Wolf was finally too cold to continue and tried to pull up his tail, but when he turned his head to look, he saw that his tail was stuck in the ice. He gave a  great pull, and what do you know but his tail came off with a “pa”  sound. Wolf fled.",

It wanted to cross to the other side [of the bridge] to gather mushrooms. \nJust at that moment, it saw that Uncle Goat was standing on the other side of the bridge preparing to cross. The bridge was very narrow, and only one creature could cross at a time.\nThe little white rabbit saw this, and stopped walking, saying loudly, “Uncle Goat, you go across the bridge first!” Saying this, it retreated from the bridge. \nUncle Goat put on his glasses, leaned on his walking stick, and began to slowly cross the bridge. Uncle Goat wasn’t careful for a moment and he fell over. Frightened, Little White Rabbit loudly yelled: “Uncle Goat, be careful as you cross the bridge!” \nUncle Goat crossed the bridge and patted the little rabbit on the head in praise, saying: “You’re very well-behaved!” \n",

    "summary": "A short story about an older cat teaching a younger cat a lesson as they fish together.\nThe most interesting thing you’ll learn here is the contrast between the two phrases “三心二意” and “一心一意”. The first, 三心二意, literally translates as “three hearts two intentions”, and it means to be of two minds about something, or to be a bit scatterbrained while doing something. The second, 一心一意, translates into “one heart one intention”, which means “intently”, or to really concentrate on what you’re doing.\n",

    "englishText": "\nLong ago, there was a little child whose father was dead, whose mother was sick, and who had a rough life in general. The child woke up early every day, and scooping up a basket of fried breadsticks, ran about shouting “Buy breadsticks, buy breadsticks, they’re fragrant and crispy, two coppers buys one!” One day, after he’d sold all his breadsticks, he sat on a rock by the side of the road and counted all the coppers in the basket one at a time – he had exactly 100.  Well, selling breadsticks had made his two hands greasy, and when he used hands to count the coppers, it had made the coppers greasy. Looking at these greasy, bright coppers, he was happy, and in his heart he thought, “Today I sold 100-worth, I can buy mother some medicine.” \nThe child had been running all morning, he was exhausted, so he let his head droop, leaned against a rock, and, snoring “hu hu” [sound of snoring], fell asleep – after he’d slept a bit he finally woke up. “Ai ya! I have to quickly run and buy medicine for mother!” The child stood up but, oh no, there was not a single coin in the basket. The child was worried and broken-hearted, and began to cry “wu wu” [sounds like 'boo hoo'].  It was just then that Bao Gong, with his men and horses, happened to walk past.\nNow, who was Bao Gong? Bao Gong was an official, black of face and black of beard, whom the people called “Old Black Bao” or “Black Bao Gong”; he handled matters fairly, and was very smart. Bao Gong saw the child crying so broken-heartedly, and he asked: “Child, why are you crying?” “The money from selling bread sticks is gone, Boo Hoooo!” \nBao Gong thought for a moment and said, “I know, it was definitely this rock that stole your money, I’ll question the rock, and tell it to give you your money back.” The people nearby heard that Bao Gong was going to interrogate a rock, and they thought this was very strange, so they all ran over and watched excitedly. Bao Gong said to the rock: “Rock, rock, was it you that stole the child’s coppers?” But can a rock speak? It cannot. Bao Gong asked again: “Rock, rock, the child’s coppers, wasn’t it you who stole them? Speak up, speak up!” The rock still said nothing, it couldn’t speak. Bao Gong exploded, “Rock, rock, tell the truth or I’ll beat you over the head!” Bao Gong’s men heard him say this, and they found a stick for him, and he began to pi li pa la [sound of stick hitting rock] hit the rock, hitting and shouting “Speak up! Speak up!” \nThe people watching excitedly roared with laughter, and chattering “ji ji zha zha” [sound of many people chattering], said: “How can a rock steal money?” “How can a rock speak?” and “Everyone said that Bao Gong is smart, actually he’s a muddled idiot!” Bao Gong heard all this and was very angry, so he said: ” I’m interrogating this rock. How can you all say bad things about me? Huh! Each one of you will be fined one copper!” Bao Gong called his men to bring him a borrowed pot – he poured water into it, and made every spectator throw one copper in the pot. The spectators had no choice, they had to line up and each one had to put one copper in the pot. “Pu tong, pu tong, pu tong…” [the sound of metal coins plunking into a pot]\nWhen one man in particular put his copper in the pot, Bao Gong ordered his men to seize this man. Bao Gong pointed at the man and said, “You’re the thief, you took the coppers the child made from selling breadsticks!” Everyone thought that was very strange, for how could it be? Bao Gong said: “All of you look, it was only when this man dropped a copper in the pot that a film of oil floated to the surface, his copper is certainly one that he took advantage of a sleeping child to steal.” The thief had no choice, he had to give the 100 coppers back to the child. Everyone said, Bao Gong sure is clever.\n",

    "summary": "Finally! A rather long, but simple from start-to-finish, children’s fable. This is definitely my favorite find so far, as it falls solidly within my favorite Chinese story genre with my favorite Chinese archetype: the clever government official who catches a crook. The official in this case is Bao Gong (包公) a historical figure from who lived from 999-1062 A.D. and who, like so many historical figures in Chinese history, somehow became a fictional story character. Bao Gong was known to be fair, just and smart.\nIn this story, you can also expect to learn a few Chinese onomatopoeia, words that sound like what they are, like the English word “boom”. There’s a ton of them in here. We find “呜呜” wū wū, the Chinese equivalent of “Boo Hoo!”. There’s also 劈里啪啦 pī li pā la, the sound of someone whacking something (in this case, with a stick). There’s 扑通 pū tōng, the Chinese equivalent of the English word “plunk” – the sound of something falling into water. And there’s 唧唧喳喳 jī jī zhā zhā, the sound of a crowd of people chattering.\nI probably added way too many words to the word list for this post, but I couldn’t bring myself to take any of these out.\n",

        "Long ago, there was a little child whose father was dead, whose mother was sick, and who had a rough life in general. The child woke up early every day, and scooping up a basket of fried breadsticks, ran about shouting “Buy breadsticks, buy breadsticks, they’re fragrant and crispy, two coppers buys one!” One day, after he’d sold all his breadsticks, he sat on a rock by the side of the road and counted all the coppers in the basket one at a time – he had exactly 100.  Well, selling breadsticks had made his two hands greasy, and when he used hands to count the coppers, it had made the coppers greasy. Looking at these greasy, bright coppers, he was happy, and in his heart he thought, “Today I sold 100-worth, I can buy mother some medicine.” ",
        "The child had been running all morning, he was exhausted, so he let his head droop, leaned against a rock, and, snoring “hu hu” [sound of snoring], fell asleep – after he’d slept a bit he finally woke up. “Ai ya! I have to quickly run and buy medicine for mother!” The child stood up but, oh no, there was not a single coin in the basket. The child was worried and broken-hearted, and began to cry “wu wu” [sounds like 'boo hoo'].  It was just then that Bao Gong, with his men and horses, happened to walk past.",
        "Now, who was Bao Gong? Bao Gong was an official, black of face and black of beard, whom the people called “Old Black Bao” or “Black Bao Gong”; he handled matters fairly, and was very smart. Bao Gong saw the child crying so broken-heartedly, and he asked: “Child, why are you crying?” “The money from selling bread sticks is gone, Boo Hoooo!” ",
        "Bao Gong thought for a moment and said, “I know, it was definitely this rock that stole your money, I’ll question the rock, and tell it to give you your money back.” The people nearby heard that Bao Gong was going to interrogate a rock, and they thought this was very strange, so they all ran over and watched excitedly. Bao Gong said to the rock: “Rock, rock, was it you that stole the child’s coppers?” But can a rock speak? It cannot. Bao Gong asked again: “Rock, rock, the child’s coppers, wasn’t it you who stole them? Speak up, speak up!” The rock still said nothing, it couldn’t speak. Bao Gong exploded, “Rock, rock, tell the truth or I’ll beat you over the head!” Bao Gong’s men heard him say this, and they found a stick for him, and he began to pi li pa la [sound of stick hitting rock] hit the rock, hitting and shouting “Speak up! Speak up!” ",
        "The people watching excitedly roared with laughter, and chattering “ji ji zha zha” [sound of many people chattering], said: “How can a rock steal money?” “How can a rock speak?” and “Everyone said that Bao Gong is smart, actually he’s a muddled idiot!” Bao Gong heard all this and was very angry, so he said: ” I’m interrogating this rock. How can you all say bad things about me? Huh! Each one of you will be fined one copper!” Bao Gong called his men to bring him a borrowed pot – he poured water into it, and made every spectator throw one copper in the pot. The spectators had no choice, they had to line up and each one had to put one copper in the pot. “Pu tong, pu tong, pu tong…” [the sound of metal coins plunking into a pot]",
        "When one man in particular put his copper in the pot, Bao Gong ordered his men to seize this man. Bao Gong pointed at the man and said, “You’re the thief, you took the coppers the child made from selling breadsticks!” Everyone thought that was very strange, for how could it be? Bao Gong said: “All of you look, it was only when this man dropped a copper in the pot that a film of oil floated to the surface, his copper is certainly one that he took advantage of a sleeping child to steal.” The thief had no choice, he had to give the 100 coppers back to the child. Everyone said, Bao Gong sure is clever."

        "从前有个小孩，爸爸死了，妈妈病了，日子可不好过了。小孩每天一早起来，提着一篮油条，一边跑，一边嚷:“卖油条咯，卖油条咯: 又香又脆的油条，两个铜钱买一根。” 有一天，他把油条全卖完了，坐在路边一块石头上，把篮子里的铜钱一个一个的数了一遍，正好一百个。他卖油条，把一双手弄得油乎乎的，用手数铜钱，把铜钱也弄得油乎乎的。他瞧着这些油乎乎亮闪闪的铜钱，可高兴了，心想: “今天卖了一百个钱，可以给妈妈买药了。”",
        "小孩跑了一个上午，可累坏了，他把头一歪，靠在石头上，就呼呼地睡着了，睡了好一会儿才醒来。“哎呀，我得赶快给妈妈买药去了。”小孩站起来一看，糟了，篮子里的铜钱一个也没有了。小孩又着急，又伤心，呜呜地哭了起来。这时候，正好包公带了人马打这儿走过。",
        "包公是什么人呀？包公是个官，黑脸黑胡子，人家叫他“包老黑”，又叫他“黑包公”，他办事公道，又很聪明。包公看见小孩哭得很伤心，就问他: “小孩，你为什么哭呀？”“我卖油条得的钱不见了，呜——呜。”“谁偷了你的钱？”“不知道。我靠在这块石头上睡着了，醒来一看，钱就不见了。呜——呜。”",
        "包公想了一想说: “我知道了，一定是这块石头偷了你的钱，我来审问这块石头，叫它把钱还给你。”人们听说包公要审问石头，觉得很奇怪，都跑来看热闹。包公对那块石头说: “石头，石头，小孩的铜钱，是不是你偷的？”石头会说话吗？不会。包公又问了: “石头，石头，小孩的铜钱，是不是你偷的？快说，快说！”石头还是一声不响，它不会说话呀。包公发火了: “石头，石头，你不说实话，打烂你的头。”手下的人听包公这么一说，就拿起棍子，劈里啪啦地打起石头来，一边打，一边喊: “快说，快说！”",
        "看热闹的人哄的笑起来了，唧唧喳喳地说: “石头怎么会偷钱？”“石头怎么会说话？”“人家都说包公聪明，原来是个胡涂蛋！”包公听了很生气，就说: “我在审问石头，你们怎么说我的坏话。哼! 你们每个人都得罚一个铜钱！”包公叫手下的人借来一只盆子，倒上水，让看热闹的人往盆子里丢一个铜钱。看热闹的人没办法，只好排着队每人往盆子里丢一个铜钱，“扑通，扑通，扑通……”",
        "有一个人刚把铜钱丢进盆子里去，就给包公叫手下的人抓住了。 包公指着这个人说: “你是小偷，你偷了小孩卖油条得来的铜钱！”大家都觉得很奇怪，这是怎么回事呀？包公说: “你们瞧，只有他丢下的铜钱，水面上浮起了一层油，他的铜钱一定是趁小孩睡觉的时候偷来的。” 那个小偷没办法，只好把一百个铜钱还给小孩。 大家都说，包公真聪明。"

    "summary": "A sweet essay about a young child doing something nice for her mother.\nThis story has two proper nouns in it, which I should probably explain. The words 《大宅门》, which is the title of a TV show called “Grand Gate Mansion”. This is a real Chinese TV soap / drama. If you want to watch it, here’s a full video episode of Grand Gate Mansion. Another interesting thing about that is the punctuation 《 and 》, marks that don’t exist in English. In English, when we refer to the name of a book or movie, we often put the name in quotes, for example, “Cinderella” or “Gone with the Wind”. These 《》 punctuation marks are the equivalent of quotes in English, but while we use quotes for lots of purposes, the Chinese only ever use these to describe the name of a play, book, movie or show.\nThe other proper noun is 明明, a young girl’s name.\nOne of the things I really like about this is also the juxtaposition between the three words 小心, 放心 and 开心, which mean “to be careful or cautious”, “to stop worrying”, and “to be happy / to have fun”, respectively. You’ll notice these words all end in 心, “heart”, and these words could literally be translated as “small heart”, “to let go of your heart”, and “open heart”. When you’re being careful, doesn’t it feel like your heart is small? And when you stop worrying about something, isn’t it just like “putting your heart down”? And when you’re having fun, isn’t it just like you have an “open heart”?\nThe Chinese title of this little narrative is 我为妈妈做点儿事.\n",

You’re welcome to tackle it if it sounds interesting.\nAlmost all news headlines, with a few exceptions, are advanced reading material. I know most of my readers are beginner-level, so I apologize for the emphasis on advanced stuff. But the upshot is that news headlines are very short, which may give lower-level readers a shot at tackling something a bit more difficult.\n",

    "englishText": "\nHan Feng silently hid beneath a thick pile of dead leaves, motionless, as calm as a hibernating snake; no, he was even more silent than a snake. No one would think that a strong life could exist inside such a motley, rotten pile of dead leaves, it was as if [the pile] had always been this way. There was no way to imagine  that a person could hide in this environment for two days without food or drink, not moving a whisker. In this vast primeval forest, the weather was so stiflingly hot as to make men suffocate, as if they were rotting from head to toe; needless to say the clamminess was very uncomfortable, moreso since Han Feng was covered in a thick pile of dead leaves – it was difficult to even draw breath. \nAnd so Han Feng hid there not making a sound, his very sense of life nearly fading away, as special units came and went around him; even the most expert trackers, the “Quick Foxes” special forces unit, didn’t discover his position.\nHe didn’t move, he didn’t dare, because he knew that in the forest special forces experts were laying in wait to ambush him. He must be the most patient hunter, or else he would become someone else’s prey. Everyone else in his group had already been “hung”. In the “massacre” three days before, they’d “died” in battle one after the other. But he, relying on his superior sixth sense and freakish agility, had escaped his opponent’s ambush, and had also “killed” more than a few of supremely experienced special forces elite, somehow taking no wounds himself. It was a real miracle that he’d managed this under attack from 10-plus special forces elite groups!\nTo this Commando Competition, an international “special forces soldier” face-off held once every five years, came elite commandos from the world’s seven major military regions. Each [soldier] had [proven themselves] in numerous battles – it would not be unrealistic to say that any one you picked out of the bunch could single-handedly wipe out a whole unit of regular soldiers. This Commando Competition was a real military engagement, everything was like a real war, except for the fact that blanks are used for ammunition, all other equipment was special forces standard issue. A ten day limit, no reinforcements, no support, every man for himself, anyone eliminated is out of the running. \n",

    "summary": "This Chinese excerpt is from the modern militant action novel “Cold Thorn”, or 冷刺, written by 天地飘鸥. You’ll be reading the first part of Chapter 1: King of the Commandos (特种兵之王).\nThe language here is very heavy on the cheesy military slang, so if you like action movies and thrillers, you’ll be able to catch quite a few of the cliches.\nIf you’d like to finish reading the book after you finish this first bit, the full text is available online from Sina.com‘s book archive.\n",

        "Han Feng silently hid beneath a thick pile of dead leaves, motionless, as calm as a hibernating snake; no, he was even more silent than a snake. No one would think that a strong life could exist inside such a motley, rotten pile of dead leaves, it was as if [the pile] had always been this way. There was no way to imagine  that a person could hide in this environment for two days without food or drink, not moving a whisker. In this vast primeval forest, the weather was so stiflingly hot as to make men suffocate, as if they were rotting from head to toe; needless to say the clamminess was very uncomfortable, moreso since Han Feng was covered in a thick pile of dead leaves – it was difficult to even draw breath. ",
        "And so Han Feng hid there not making a sound, his very sense of life nearly fading away, as special units came and went around him; even the most expert trackers, the “Quick Foxes” special forces unit, didn’t discover his position.",
        "He didn’t move, he didn’t dare, because he knew that in the forest special forces experts were laying in wait to ambush him. He must be the most patient hunter, or else he would become someone else’s prey. Everyone else in his group had already been “hung”. In the “massacre” three days before, they’d “died” in battle one after the other. But he, relying on his superior sixth sense and freakish agility, had escaped his opponent’s ambush, and had also “killed” more than a few of supremely experienced special forces elite, somehow taking no wounds himself. It was a real miracle that he’d managed this under attack from 10-plus special forces elite groups!",
        "To this Commando Competition, an international “special forces soldier” face-off held once every five years, came elite commandos from the world’s seven major military regions. Each [soldier] had [proven themselves] in numerous battles – it would not be unrealistic to say that any one you picked out of the bunch could single-handedly wipe out a whole unit of regular soldiers. This Commando Competition was a real military engagement, everything was like a real war, except for the fact that blanks are used for ammunition, all other equipment was special forces standard issue. A ten day limit, no reinforcements, no support, every man for himself, anyone eliminated is out of the running. "

        "韩枫静静地伏在厚厚的落叶下，一动不动，安静得如同一条冬眠的蛇，不，他比蛇还要无声无息，谁也不会想到斑驳腐烂的落叶堆里会有这样坚强的生命存在，仿佛亘古就是如此。真是无法想象一个人能在这样的环境中潜伏两天两夜，不吃不喝，纹丝不动。在苍茫的原始丛林中，空气闷热得令人窒息，浑身就像霉烂了似的，湿漉漉的感觉别提有多难受了，何况韩枫的身上还捂着这么厚的一堆落叶，真是连气也喘不过来了。",
        "韩枫就这样无声无息地潜伏着，安静得几乎连生命的体征也消失了，身边来来往往已经过去了几个特种小组，就连最擅长追踪的“灵狐”特战小组也没有发现他。",
        "他不能动，也不敢动，因为他知道林中还有不少特战高手在伺机狙杀，他要做最有耐心的猎人而不是成为别人的猎物。他们这一组除了他，其他人都“挂”了，在三天前残酷的“杀戮”中先后“阵亡”，而他，凭着超强的第六感和匪夷所思的身手不但逃过了对方的狙杀，而且还“杀”了数名富有经验的特战精英，居然毫发无伤。在十多个特战精英小组的攻击下能做到这一点，真是奇迹！",
        "这次的特种兵大比武，是五年一度的全国“特种兵”对抗大赛，来自全国七大军区的特战精英，个个都是身经百战的高手，随便挑出一个，横扫一个普通连队绝不是痴人说梦。这次的特种兵大比武是实兵对抗，一切从实战出发，除了弹药是空包弹外，其他都是特种部队必需的武器装备。十天为限，没有后援，没有给养，各自为战，淘汰者出局。"

    "englishText": "\nA child sitting under a tree prayed quietly to himself without anyone knowing – only the tree knew. \nThe tree was several decades old, but it still stood straight and tall. The people in the village all knew that a while ago, this trees bark was falling off and it was dying. But it was brought back to life by a short phrase that its caretaker said, and when other people asked the young girl [caretaker] how she healed the tree, the girl said with a sweet smile, “It’s a secret”. Everyone was puzzled. \nA few years later, the girl went to a far away place to [earn money for] her little brother’s school tuition. A very far away place. The tree once again began to calmly lower its head [meaning to droop]. After a few more seasons passed, the tree was about to die, and at its side a new tree grew. The new tree was always treating the older tree with contempt, and often said, “Rotting old one, look how old and filthy you are, and look how young I am!” The old tree looked at the little tree and heaved a big sigh. The little tree said, “Rotting one, what are you looking at?” The old tree still said nothing. The old tree was always weeping silently during the night.\nAfter another year had passed, the young girl returned. She saw how haggard the old tree had become, and she was sad. She again said a few words to the tree. The tree unexpectedly became its old self once again, tall and straight. The villagers praised it as they came and went. After another week, the girl had to leave again. Crying, the girl’s mother said, “Daughter, your father and I have let you down.” The girl, also crying, said, “Don’t speak that way. Can you summon my little brother?” “Of course I can.”\nThe sister said to her little brother, “This tree I give to you, when you look at it, it shall be the same as looking at me. Study hard, make me proud, and make mom and dad proud. You must safeguard it [the tree]. I may be gone for 3-5 years. Take good care of mom and dad, and that will make me proud.” The little brother said, “Sister, I know I’ll be industrious, and I’ll take good care of the tree.” Touching the tree [one last time], the girl turned and left. As each day passed, the boy grew up. During the day he studied and played beneath the tree, and at night, he sat against the tree and quietly prayed. After a few more months the boy ran to the top of a mountain and yelled out the words he’d been wanting to say, “Sister, come home!”\nA few years later, he suddenly learned some startling news. It was said that the sister had died saving a little girl’s life. This had happened several years before, and the money that was sent to the village was sent by the little girl’s mother, because this was the sister’s final request before she died. \nPeople all say that good people go to heaven after they die. I think that that girl [the sister] is surely in heaven watching over her brother!\n",

    "summary": "This very sad and vaguely metaphorical story is a bit long for beginner reading, but other than a couple of high-level words, the sentence structure isn’t too crazy and the basic language is simple.\nThe story kind of goes back and forth between a younger brother, an elder sister, and a tree. In order to read and understand this story, you need to move away from the standard Western conception of a story – the things that my Western mind seized on as important points in the story (“What are the secret words the sister says to the tree?”) turned out to be ancillary. Like many melancholy Chinese prose, it should be read by just letting the ideas and images wash over you.\nThe story will be difficult to read if you try to follow some cohesive narrative – don’t bother. Just revel in the bleakness of the ideas.\n",

        "\nA child sitting under a tree prayed quietly to himself without anyone knowing – only the tree knew",
        " \nThe tree was several decades old, but it still stood straight and tall",
        " The people in the village all knew that a while ago, this trees bark was falling off and it was dying",
        " But it was brought back to life by a short phrase that its caretaker said, and when other people asked the young girl [caretaker] how she healed the tree, the girl said with a sweet smile, “It’s a secret”",
        " Everyone was puzzled",
        " \nA few years later, the girl went to a far away place to [earn money for] her little brother’s school tuition",
        " A very far away place",
        " The tree once again began to calmly lower its head [meaning to droop]",
        " After a few more seasons passed, the tree was about to die, and at its side a new tree grew",
        " The new tree was always treating the older tree with contempt, and often said, “Rotting old one, look how old and filthy you are, and look how young I am!” The old tree looked at the little tree and heaved a big sigh",
        " The little tree said, “Rotting one, what are you looking at?” The old tree still said nothing",
        " The old tree was always weeping silently during the night",
        "\nAfter another year had passed, the young girl returned",
        " She saw how haggard the old tree had become, and she was sad",
        " She again said a few words to the tree",
        " The tree unexpectedly became its old self once again, tall and straight",
        " The villagers praised it as they came and went",
        " After another week, the girl had to leave again",
        " Crying, the girl’s mother said, “Daughter, your father and I have let you down",
        "” The girl, also crying, said, “Don’t speak that way",
        " Can you summon my little brother?” “Of course I can",
        "”\nThe sister said to her little brother, “This tree I give to you, when you look at it, it shall be the same as looking at me",
        " Study hard, make me proud, and make mom and dad proud",
        " You must safeguard it [the tree]",
        " I may be gone for 3-5 years",
        " Take good care of mom and dad, and that will make me proud",
        "” The little brother said, “Sister, I know I’ll be industrious, and I’ll take good care of the tree",
        "” Touching the tree [one last time], the girl turned and left",
        " As each day passed, the boy grew up",
        " During the day he studied and played beneath the tree, and at night, he sat against the tree and quietly prayed",
        " After a few more months the boy ran to the top of a mountain and yelled out the words he’d been wanting to say, “Sister, come home!”\nA few years later, he suddenly learned some startling news",

        "A child sitting under a tree prayed quietly to himself without anyone knowing – only the tree knew. ",
        "The tree was several decades old, but it still stood straight and tall. The people in the village all knew that a while ago, this trees bark was falling off and it was dying. But it was brought back to life by a short phrase that its caretaker said, and when other people asked the young girl [caretaker] how she healed the tree, the girl said with a sweet smile, “It’s a secret”. Everyone was puzzled. ",
        "A few years later, the girl went to a far away place to [earn money for] her little brother’s school tuition. A very far away place. The tree once again began to calmly lower its head [meaning to droop]. After a few more seasons passed, the tree was about to die, and at its side a new tree grew. The new tree was always treating the older tree with contempt, and often said, “Rotting old one, look how old and filthy you are, and look how young I am!” The old tree looked at the little tree and heaved a big sigh. The little tree said, “Rotting one, what are you looking at?” The old tree still said nothing. The old tree was always weeping silently during the night.",
        "After another year had passed, the young girl returned. She saw how haggard the old tree had become, and she was sad. She again said a few words to the tree. The tree unexpectedly became its old self once again, tall and straight. The villagers praised it as they came and went. After another week, the girl had to leave again. Crying, the girl’s mother said, “Daughter, your father and I have let you down.” The girl, also crying, said, “Don’t speak that way. Can you summon my little brother?” “Of course I can.”",
        "The sister said to her little brother, “This tree I give to you, when you look at it, it shall be the same as looking at me. Study hard, make me proud, and make mom and dad proud. You must safeguard it [the tree]. I may be gone for 3-5 years. Take good care of mom and dad, and that will make me proud.” The little brother said, “Sister, I know I’ll be industrious, and I’ll take good care of the tree.” Touching the tree [one last time], the girl turned and left. As each day passed, the boy grew up. During the day he studied and played beneath the tree, and at night, he sat against the tree and quietly prayed. After a few more months the boy ran to the top of a mountain and yelled out the words he’d been wanting to say, “Sister, come home!”",
        "A few years later, he suddenly learned some startling news. It was said that the sister had died saving a little girl’s life. This had happened several years before, and the money that was sent to the village was sent by the little girl’s mother, because this was the sister’s final request before she died. ",

Well, you find another skilled student with good grades to substitute. \nI’m a [class monitor] substitute; when the class monitor isn’t there, the teacher asks me instead, and I’m happy to do some work for the teacher. \nThis one day, the class monitor had just left to do something, so I ran up to the podium to oversee classroom discipline. The classroom was disorderly and loud, no one was paying attention to me. I called out loudly: “Everyone return to your places, we’re going to call roll.” The classroom immediately quieted down a bit, most students returned to their seats, but for a few, my words went in one ear and out the other, and they immersed themselves in their game of San Guo Sha. \nIndignant, I wrote the names [of the misbehaving students] on the blackboard in big letters. They tried vehemently to argue, saying :”Why are you writing my name?” I had just thought up a [stinging] retort, but the class inspector arrived, and I calmly said, “The inspector has arrived, you must not be noisy, or else you’ll be assigned extra homework.” They immediately shut their mouths. Ai, it’s no fun being the class monitor! \nAs soon as the classroom inspector left, they once again ignored my protests, continued being noisy, and snapped, “What are you on your high horse about, you’re just a substitute.” They said this in a [mean]-spirited way. I turned away, tears welling in my eyes, but I tolerated it and did not argue with them.\nFinally, the class monitor returned, and I stopped [living] my “life as a substitute”. \nAi, being a substitute is more trouble than being the real thing. \n",

    "summary": "This is a slightly sad blurb about a substitue 班长, or classroom leader. If you’ve ever used Chinese-made textbooks to study, or if you’re studying language in China, this could be managable for a beginner, otherwise, consider it an intermediate passage.\nChinese beginner textbooks are often filled with classroom-y words, and stories about inter-student and student-teacher relationships, so this should make a bit more intuitive sense if you’ve ever been in a real Chinese classroom environment.\nIn my opinion, there’s no good English translation for the word 班长. In Chinese classrooms, one student is elected the class leader – they are responsible for keeping other students in line, are given extra classroom duties, and are akin to a teacher’s pet. But in English, the word “teacher’s pet” has a negative meaning. Not so in Chinese classrooms, where being the 班长 is considered a real privilege.\nOne of the more difficult clauses here is … 埋头继续玩”三国杀”. This means “… immersed themselves in continuing to play San Guo Sha.” San Guo Sha is a popular Asian card game (which, I understand, has been turned into an online multiplayer network game).\n",

        "This one day, the class monitor had just left to do something, so I ran up to the podium to oversee classroom discipline. The classroom was disorderly and loud, no one was paying attention to me. I called out loudly: “Everyone return to your places, we’re going to call roll.” The classroom immediately quieted down a bit, most students returned to their seats, but for a few, my words went in one ear and out the other, and they immersed themselves in their game of San Guo Sha. ",
        "Indignant, I wrote the names [of the misbehaving students] on the blackboard in big letters. They tried vehemently to argue, saying :”Why are you writing my name?” I had just thought up a [stinging] retort, but the class inspector arrived, and I calmly said, “The inspector has arrived, you must not be noisy, or else you’ll be assigned extra homework.” They immediately shut their mouths. Ai, it’s no fun being the class monitor! ",

As soon as it had finished drawing, the mouse yawned, stretched, and came to life. \nThe mouse ran up to the pencil and said: “I’m starving, give me something to eat quick!” The pencil drew some bread. The bread was deliciously savory, and the little mouse gobbled it right up. After it finished the bread, the mouse ran back to the pencil and said: “Bread isn’t sweet, I want to eat a big cake!” The pencil drew a big cake. This cake was light, soft and sweet, and on the top it had a thick layer of cream, and on top of the cream there were peanut and melon seeds.  \nThe mouse squinted his eyes and ate with gusto, and when he’d eaten an entire piece of cake, his stomach was very full. However, he still wanted to eat, so he said: “The cake was too sweet, I want to eat something salty!” The pencil drew him a sausage, and the mouse ate the sausage right up. The mouse’s stomach was round as a drum, or a big ball, and there was no way he could cram anything else in there. To the pencil he said, “I’m full, but I have no place to live, you must give me a house!” \nThe pencil drew a big mouse hole, inside there were several tunnels, a place to sleep, and also a storehouse. The mouse ran into the hole, looked all around, and said: “There should be some foodstuffs in the storehouse.” In the storehouse, the pencil drew millet, peanuts, corn… the mouse nodded and said: “The house is pretty good, but it’s a pity there’s no bed.” The pencil drew a pile of straw, and on top of the straw he spread cotton wadding – this is a mouse’s most comfortable [type of] bed. \nThe mouse jumped onto the bed, rolled around a bit, and said, satisfied: “Not bad!” Then, the mouse ran over to the pencil and began to ferociously suck on it. The pencil cried out: “Aiyo! Are you cheating me? You’re nibbling all my skin off!” The mouse said: “Hey hey, I have everything I want now, but my teeth itch, and I have no place to grind them. Your body is long and thin, it’s a perfect place for me to grind my teeth.” The pencil said: “Wait a second, I’ll draw you something similar, and you can grind your teeth on that.”\nSaying this, the pencil began to draw. When it had finished drawing a mewing cat jumped up [from the paper] and swallowed the mouse. \n",

        " To the pencil he said, “I’m full, but I have no place to live, you must give me a house!” \nThe pencil drew a big mouse hole, inside there were several tunnels, a place to sleep, and also a storehouse",
        " The mouse ran into the hole, looked all around, and said: “There should be some foodstuffs in the storehouse",
        "” In the storehouse, the pencil drew millet, peanuts, corn… the mouse nodded and said: “The house is pretty good, but it’s a pity there’s no bed",
        "” The pencil drew a pile of straw, and on top of the straw he spread cotton wadding – this is a mouse’s most comfortable [type of] bed",
        " \nThe mouse jumped onto the bed, rolled around a bit, and said, satisfied: “Not bad!” Then, the mouse ran over to the pencil and began to ferociously suck on it",
        " The pencil cried out: “Aiyo! Are you cheating me? You’re nibbling all my skin off!” The mouse said: “Hey hey, I have everything I want now, but my teeth itch, and I have no place to grind them",
        " Your body is long and thin, it’s a perfect place for me to grind my teeth",
        "” The pencil said: “Wait a second, I’ll draw you something similar, and you can grind your teeth on that",
        "”\nSaying this, the pencil began to draw",

        "There was an old grandfather who gave Xiao Feng a pencil. This was no ordinary pencil, it was a magic pencil. At night, Xiao Feng went to sleep. The pencil stood up on its own, and draw a mouse on a piece of paper. As soon as it had finished drawing, the mouse yawned, stretched, and came to life. ",
        "The mouse ran up to the pencil and said: “I’m starving, give me something to eat quick!” The pencil drew some bread. The bread was deliciously savory, and the little mouse gobbled it right up. After it finished the bread, the mouse ran back to the pencil and said: “Bread isn’t sweet, I want to eat a big cake!” The pencil drew a big cake. This cake was light, soft and sweet, and on the top it had a thick layer of cream, and on top of the cream there were peanut and melon seeds.  ",
        "The mouse squinted his eyes and ate with gusto, and when he’d eaten an entire piece of cake, his stomach was very full. However, he still wanted to eat, so he said: “The cake was too sweet, I want to eat something salty!” The pencil drew him a sausage, and the mouse ate the sausage right up. The mouse’s stomach was round as a drum, or a big ball, and there was no way he could cram anything else in there. To the pencil he said, “I’m full, but I have no place to live, you must give me a house!” ",
        "The pencil drew a big mouse hole, inside there were several tunnels, a place to sleep, and also a storehouse. The mouse ran into the hole, looked all around, and said: “There should be some foodstuffs in the storehouse.” In the storehouse, the pencil drew millet, peanuts, corn… the mouse nodded and said: “The house is pretty good, but it’s a pity there’s no bed.” The pencil drew a pile of straw, and on top of the straw he spread cotton wadding – this is a mouse’s most comfortable [type of] bed. ",
        "The mouse jumped onto the bed, rolled around a bit, and said, satisfied: “Not bad!” Then, the mouse ran over to the pencil and began to ferociously suck on it. The pencil cried out: “Aiyo! Are you cheating me? You’re nibbling all my skin off!” The mouse said: “Hey hey, I have everything I want now, but my teeth itch, and I have no place to grind them. Your body is long and thin, it’s a perfect place for me to grind my teeth.” The pencil said: “Wait a second, I’ll draw you something similar, and you can grind your teeth on that.”",
        "Saying this, the pencil began to draw. When it had finished drawing a mewing cat jumped up [from the paper] and swallowed the mouse. "
